Their suit names Baltimore City School Board of Commissioners, city council and Mayor Brandon Scott as defendants. \"It\'s all about power and control,\" Patterson said of the school system. \"There\'s a lot of money in education.\" That\'s $1.62 billion a year in Baltimore City Public Schools, to be exact. Baltimore has the fourth-highest funded large school system in the nation, behind only New York, Boston and Washington, D.C. Charm City\'s school budget increased 16% this school year, according to the city. All that money � approximately $21,600 per student � isn\'t adding up to better outcomes. Baltimore had the lowest graduation rate across Maryland during the last school year. At one high school, 77% of students read at an elementary or kindergarten level. And in February, FOX45\'s Project Baltimore broke the news that 23 schools had zero students score proficient on a state math exam. The state then removed the data and re-uploaded a heavily-redacted version. \"I think that they\'re trying to hide that the public school system is in worse shape than we thought,\" a whistleblower who previously worked in the Maryland State Department of Education told Project Baltimore. Patterson agreed, telling Fox News \"there\'s clearly a cover-up going on here.\"  WHY BALTIMORE�S THOUSANDS OF VACANT BUILDINGS ARE A �CRISIS OF EPIC PROPORTIONS� \"There\'s clearly things that we see that they don\'t want the people of the public to know when it comes to educating our kids,\" he said. The question is simple for Patterson: Should Baltimore City students receive a good education? \"If you believe the answer to that is yes, then you should be joined in with this lawsuit as well,\" he said. Baltimore\'s education woes are uniting people across the political spectrum. Patterson made an unsuccessful bid for city council president as a Republican in 2020. But prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump has joined his lawsuit. \"If you don�t get a quality education, often times you find yourself a victim of the school-to-prison pipeline,\" Crump told FOX45. \"Hopefully, with this lawsuit, we can get it right and that way it can help make � not just Baltimore better � but it can help make cities across America better.\" A spokesperson for Baltimore City Public Schools called the Pattersons� lawsuit \"meritless because it fails to identify a current controversy justifying judicial intervention\" in an email to Fox News. \"Even if the plaintiffs� lawsuit identified current concerns with City School policies or procedures, there is a robust local, state, and federal infrastructure to handle these types of issues,\" the spokesperson continued, adding that \"City Schools stands ready to demonstrate our steadfast commitment to providing a quality education to all students.\" The legal process could drag on for years, according to Patterson\'s attorney. A judge allowed the case to move into the discovery and deposition phase late last year after denying the city and school system\'s request to dismiss the suit.   But Patterson said he\'s in it for the long haul. \"Someone has to stay and fight,\" he said. \"I met my wife here, [had] both of my kids here, I was born here, bought my first house here. I planted my flag. So I\'m going to fight as long and as hard as I can.\" To see the full interview with Patterson, click here.','Hannah Ray Lambert\r'),('\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'s\' Chris Pratt says father-in-law Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s support is \'mind-blowing\'','2023-05-04T11:09:21-04:00','Not Found!','Ahead of the release of \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\" the film\'s leading star Chris Pratt is opening up about the support he has received in resuming his role in the Marvel Universe. No support is quite like that of his father-in-law, action star and former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \"Arnold\'s support means the world to me on a couple different levels. Just being his son-in-law and being part of his family, it obviously means a lot to have his support,\" Pratt shared with People magazine. Pratt is married to Schwarzenegger\'s eldest child, Katherine, whom he shares with ex-wife Maria Shriver.  ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER GUSHES OVER \'GREAT\' SON-IN-LAW CHRIS PRATT: HE\'S \'A FANTASTIC GUY\' \"But then on another level, just being somebody who grew up loving his movies, the big action hero � I dreamed of being \'Commando\' and dreamed of being the soldier from \'Predator,\' and I loved \'Terminator,\'\" he said.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER \"So for him to give me kudos for going out and being on the marquee is really kind of mind-blowing,\" Pratt added. Last week, Schwarzenegger gave his stamp of approval on Pratt\'s performance in the film, sharing to Twitter that Pratt \"crushed it.\" \"A non-stop, perfect mix of comedy and action. I loved it and I\'m very, very proud of you,\" he wrote.  This is not the first time Schwarzenegger has showered his son-in-law with compliments. While appearing on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" last year, the former governor called Pratt a \"fantastic guy\" and \"a great son-in-law.\" Pratt has been busy promoting the third installment of the film series, appearing with Katherine just last week at the premiere in Los Angeles. The movie, set to bow Friday, stars Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel and many others. Given it is reportedly the last \"Guardians\" film, Pratt is confident his tight-knit cast will stay close.  \"I know the text threads will keep going and stay strong. We\'ll be checking in on each other, like marriages and families and all the life things that happen. We\'ll be there for each other,\" he said.   Pratt, 43, admitted that Katherine\'s favorite film of his is actually not from the Marvel franchise, but is from way back in his acting career. \"Her favorite movie is �Bride Wars,�\" he admitted. The 2009 film stars Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway. \"She calls that \'true cinema.\' And I think that might be one of the only movies of mine she\'s seen,\" he noted.','Caroline Thayer\r'),('\'Star Wars\' actress Carrie Fisher honored with star on Hollywood Walk of Fame amid family drama','2023-05-04T20:38:36-04:00','Not Found!','The Force is strong with Carrie Fisher\'s family, friends and fans. On Thursday, May 4 � also known as \"Star Wars Day\" (\"May the Fourth\"), the late actress who played the iconic Princess Leia in the beloved film saga was honored with a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her daughter, Billie Lourd, was in attendance and spoke about how much the honor would have meant to her mother. \"I\'d like to say thank you so much to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce for this incredible honor. I know my mom would just be so excited and grateful,\" she said during her speech. When speaking to the fans, she added, \"The Force is obviously always with you.\" Billie said her mother didn\'t think someone was famous until they became a Pez dispenser, but Billie said fame is when you have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Now that Carrie has both, Billie noted, \"Mama, you\'ve made it.\"  \'STAR WARS\': CARRIE FISHER\'S COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH BELOVED FRANCHISE  The actress confessed that growing up she thought her mother was \"a lot embarrassing\" and that Fisher tried to change her perspective by showing her the \"cool movie she was in, �Star Wars.�\" Lourd said she would just \"roll my eyes and yell, �It�s too loud, Mommy!\'\" She admitted she finally gave in and watched the movie when she was in middle school because boys started coming up to her and telling her they \"fantasized\" about her mother. Once she finally saw the movie, she realized what all the fuss was about. \"I wanted to hate it, so I could tell her how lame she was. Like any kid, I didn�t want my mom to be hot or cool. She was my mom. But that day, staring at the screen, I realized no one is or will ever be as hot or as cool as Princess Leia,\" she said. Lourd also thanked her \"space uncle\" Mark Hamill, saying she adores him \"beyond belief.\"   BILLIE LOURD HONORS CARRIE FISHER, HIGHLIGHTS �REALITY OF GRIEF� 6 YEARS AFTER �STAR WARS� ICON\'S DEATH Hamill made a quick comment to Fox News Digital when he was asked what it means to be there for Fisher. \"It\'s all for Carrie,\" Hamill said. \"It means a lot.\" When Hamill stepped up to the podium, he reminisced about the first time he met his \"Star Wars\" co-star. \"I met Carrie when she was 19 years old � we arranged to have a dinner so that we could meet each other. I\'m thinking she\'s 19 years old, she\'s barely out of high school. I was a worldly 24,\" he explained.  \"Every expectation I had was just obliterated. She was so charming, so funny, so adorable, so wise beyond her years. I just couldn\'t believe it; and brutally frank. She started telling me stories, intimate stories about her family that I\'m thinking, �Should I be hearing this?�\" Hamill got emotional when he told the audience that he had found what he wrote six years ago, not long after Fisher passed away, and that it was still relevant today. \"What I wrote was, Carrie was one of a kind who belonged to us all whether we liked it or not. She was our princess � and the actress who played her blurred into one gorgeous, fiercely independent and ferociously funny take-charge woman who took our collective breath away,\" he said ,in part. He noted that Fisher was tough but had a \"vulnerability that made you root for her and want her to succeed and be happy.\" Hamill added that his friend was a \"handful � but everything would have been so much drabber and less interesting if she hadn\'t been the friend that she was.\"  Fisher receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame comes amid some family drama as the siblings of the late actress battle with her daughter over not being invited to the ceremony. Lourd was joined by her father, Bryan, as well as his husband, Bruce Bozzi, and their daughter, Ava, at the ceremony. The \"Scream Queens\" actress released a statement Wednesday, addressing the controversy involving Fishers\'s brother, Todd, and sister Joely. \"The truth is I did not invite them to this ceremony. They know why,\" the statement obtained by the Hollywood Reporter reads. \"Days after my mom died, her brother and her sister chose to process their grief publicly and capitalize on my mother�s death, by doing multiple interviews and selling individual books for a lot of money, with my mom and my grandmother�s deaths as the subject.\"  \"I found out they had done this through the press. They never consulted me or considered how this would affect our relationship. The truth of my mom�s very complicated relationship with her family is only known by me and those who were actually close to her,\" the statement continued. \"Though I recognize they have every right to do whatever they choose, their actions were very hurtful to me at the most difficult time in my life. I chose to and still choose to deal with her loss in a much different way.\" \"The press release Todd Fisher gave to TMZ and the posting Joely Fisher placed on Instagram, once again confirms thatmy instincts were right.To be clear � there is no feud. We have no relationship,\" she wrote. \"This was a conscious decision on my part to break a cycle with a way of life I want no part of for myself or my children.\"  Todd stated to Fox News Digital that he was specifically told that, at the family\'s request, he was not to be included. Wanting to understand what \"family,\" was making the decision, Todd reached out to other close members, including half-sisters Joely and Tricia Leigh Fisher, only to learn that they, too, had not been invited to the event. Todd says Fisher\'s good friend and actress, Beverly D\'Angelo, as well as her school friends didn\'t make the cut either. Taking matters into his own hands, Todd claims he called Lourd\'s father, Bryan, directly. Wanting to come to the event, Todd asked Bryan how they could fix things. \"That\'s when he said, �I really wish you wouldn�t � because if you go, Billie\'s not going to go,\" Todd said.   Admitting he hadn\'t spoken to Lourd in more than three years, Todd said he would not attend the event because \"it would not be very classy to arrive and cause a conflict,\" although it was important for him to clarify why he would not be there. Todd said Lourd was never overly responsive to his text messages in the first place. After Fisher died, Bryan reportedly told Todd that Lourd was struggling to process her mother\'s death and, therefore, should be given space. A representative for Lourd did not immediately return Fox News Digital\'s request for comment.  \"I\'ve always been around her, her whole life,\" Todd told Fox News Digital \"It\'s just the last handful of years that this problem has existed. But that was also when my sister and mother [were] around, everybody was very close because it was being orchestrated by a balance of the family. Now you have an unbalance in the force. And so this is what happens. � I love her and I respect her decisions, and I hope that she changes her mind on this when she understands how trite this all is,\" he added. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Joely and Tricia issued a joint statement via Instagram, sharing why they, too, would not be in attendance. \"In response to all of you asking whether or not we will be part of the celebration�.Strangely we won�t be in attendance to celebrate our sister, whom we adored. For some bizarre, misguided reason our niece has chosen not to include us in this epic moment in our sister�s career. This is something Carrie would have definitely wanted her siblings to be present for. The fact that her only brother and two sisters were intentionally and deliberately excluded is deeply shocking. We have all been grieving the loss of our favorite human for some years now�we have given Billie the space to do that in her own way,\" they said.  \"We have been nothing but loving and open, consistently. This isn�t about a photo op on Hollywood Blvd�this is about celebrating the permanency of Carrie�s legacy in this industry, taking her place with a star on the iconic walk of fame along side (sic) our parents. We thank the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce for honoring our sister in this way. May the Fourth Be with you,\" their post concluded.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Joely Fisher (@msjoelyfisher)  APP USERS CLICK HERE Speaking of his and Fisher\'s mother, Debbie Reynolds, Todd believes she would say \"everybody needs to get it together here and behave,\" if she were to witness this controversy. He believes Reynolds would have told the family, \"This isn\'t about us. This is about the star. It\'s about Carrie. It\'s about honoring the day. � My mother would\'ve likened it to Christmas. � She would say, �We all get together on a holiday sometimes with family and friends that we don�t necessarily like that much, but we do it because it\'s the holidays, and we put our differences aside for a minute, and we celebrate the birthday of Christ.\' Well this is the birthday of Carrie\'s star on Hollywood Boulevard. And I think she\'d say, �We need to all get together, put our differences aside and celebrate that legacy.�\"  ','Caroline Thayer\r'),('\'Tax the rich\' Brooklyn councilman shows out at posh Met Gala','2023-05-05T10:30:00-04:00','Not Found!','A Brooklyn city councilman known for his socialist politics and \"tax the rich\" sloganeering rubbed elbows among the elite at New York City\'s ultra-exclusive Met Gala.

There are two Sport models in red and orange and an orange Base model. FAMOUS WOODEN �PLYBERTRUCK� TESLA PARODY ON SALE  All are in the same condition they were in when they were arrived, with some of their protective wrapping still in place. The Roadster was Tesla\'s first model, and it built approximately 2,400 between 2008 and 2012, before shifting its focus to mainstream four-door vehicles.  The U.S.-spec cars are still in China, but have been listed for sale by the Gruber Motor Company, a Tesla specialist in Arizona. Gruber cannot confirm the mileage on the odometers or whether the battery packs are still functional. Unless they are disconnected, Roadster batteries can \"brick\" if unused for long periods of time. Tesla offers a new pack for purchase to update the originals.  \"Due to the bizarre nature of this set of brand new Roadsters and collectible status, this owner is accepting bids at this time only, and is trying to sell them as a set, but would entertain splitting them up,\" Gruber said in the listing.

A bid of $200,000 was placed for all three on May 3, but not yet accepted.

Morrison, 12, added that no fellow student directly confronted him about the shirt or said it offended them or made them feel unsafe. However, he was pulled out of gym class on March 21 and told to remove the shirt because several students and staff had reportedly complained. When he respectfully declined to take the shirt off, school officials called his father to come and pick him up.  10 STUNNING DISPUTES OVER FREE SPEECH BETWEEN STUDENTS, FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS In an email reviewed by Fox News Digital, Middleborough Public Schools Superintendent Carolyn Lyons stated that Morrison had violated its dress code. Specifically, the \"content of Liam�s shirt targeted students of a protected class; namely in the area of gender identity.\" The middle school student said he wore the shirt because he wanted to express his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. \"The reason that I wore it is because, well, everyone has a right to their opinions and I want to be able to voice mine on a subject that a lot of people were talking about,\" he explained. \"I definitely don\'t like that they violated what is basically the first thing that the people who were in charge of America at the time stated we were allowed to do and nowadays it feels like that\'s being taken away a lot, which is why some people choose to speak up about it.

Whiting continued, saying unless a student is causing a \"material and substantial disruption in school\" or they�re advocating for something like illegal drug use, then students have the \"right to express their political opinions- to express their beliefs on things like this.\" \"And so, you know, here they\'re trying to say that some students complained or were upset about Liam\'s shirt.

Whiting continued, saying unless a student is causing a \"material and substantial disruption in school\" or they�re advocating for something like illegal drug use, then students have the \"right to express their political opinions- to express their beliefs on things like this.\" \"And so, you know, here they\'re trying to say that some students complained or were upset about Liam\'s shirt. But the law is clear that other students being upset about something that you say doesn\'t even come close to causing that kind of substantial disruption that would justify them clamping down on your free speech rights,\" he said.  WISCONSIN MIDDLE SCHOOLERS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT FOR USING WRONG GENDER PRONOUNS Morrison shared that if a student had confronted him and told him that his shirt offended them, he wouldn�t say much other than \"They are entitled to their opinions just as I am.\" \"If you have a different view and if they asked why I was wearing it, I\'d say because I have a right to have a voice,\" he explained. He planned on wearing the shirt again to school on May 5, saying he was \"definitely ready for it.\" However, Stoneman, Chandler &amp; Miller LLP, the law firm representing the school district, informed Whiting and Morrison�s family Thursday afternoon that the school will continue to \"prohibit the wearing of a t-shirt by Liam Morrison or anyone else which is likely to be considered discriminatory, harassing and/or bullying to others including those who are gender nonconforming by suggesting that their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression does not exist or is invalid.\" Whiting said the Morrison family is preparing to take legal action against the school and that Liam plans on \"wearing something to school [on Friday] that will make a strong statement about censorship.\"  Fox News Digital reached out to Middleborough Public School for comment but has yet to receive a response.','Ashley Carnahan\r'),('America\'s civics crisis means too many students don\'t even know the Declaration of Independence','2023-05-05T08:00:49-04:00','Not Found!','Only 60 percent of American 8th graders have a basic understanding of U.S. history, according to the new Nation�s Report Card scores recently released, and only 13 percent of them are proficient in the subject. Roughly three in every ten of them lack a basic understanding of civics. In context, this means that much of the rising generation likely doesn�t know who wrote the Declaration of Independence or why the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution. They cannot tell you the reasons each side fought the Civil War or in which war the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. They don�t know about Congressional veto power or how the Electoral College works. (All of these examples are pulled from sample Nation�s Report Card questions.) These students, who are now high school freshmen, are four years away from being voters; maybe less if certain politicians succeed in lowering the voting age. We face the very real possibility of our future presidents and members of Congress being elected by people who have no idea what those jobs entail. These students deserve to participate in the civic life of this country, but they are being robbed of the tools that would let them do so in a constructive way. The problems extend beyond the ballot box: Our entire political discourse, both in the news media and in our own neighborhoods, will be swayed by people with no understanding of the American system of governance. JEAN-PIERRE SHREDDED FOR CLAIMING REOPENING SCHOOLS WAS A �PRIORITY� FOR BIDEN  This is not to say that our political discourse is particularly well-informed at this moment: Only 47 percent of Americans can name the three branches of government, according to a survey conducted by the University of Pennsylvania�s Annenberg Public Policy Center. The same study found that 26 percent could not name a single freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. In 2018, the Nation�s Report Card showed that 34 percent of 8th graders scored \"below basic\" in U.S. History, which is to say they were historically illiterate. 27 percent scored \"below basic\" in civics that same year. When people don�t understand the separation of powers, they don�t know that Supreme Court justices are supposed to decide if a law is Constitutional and not just if they think it�s a good idea. They don�t know that federal spending is supposed to originate in the House, and they don�t know the limits of Presidential power. When people don�t understand that federalism helps ensure freedom, liberty, and opportunity, they are more willing to hand power to Washington that rightfully belongs to the states.  Teacher unions and the institutional left have managed an astonishing feat of bureaucratic gymnastics: They brought politics into the classroom without civics or history. Sec. Miguel Cardona attributes these terrible test scores, wrongly, to the pandemic and politics in the classroom. The first part of his assessment is an outright lie: The pandemic never precluded anyone from teaching history, but union-led school closures sure did. The second part is correct, though Cardona�s own allies are to blame: Indoctrination in the forms of DEI, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity politics have crowded out fact-based education about the country we all share. Teachers are terrified to teach what makes America great and are instead encouraged to teach a version of history so warped by progressive politics that it can hardly be called history at all.It�s time to flip that paradigm on its head and get the politics out while bringing the core subjects back in. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER If civics is the what of American political life, history is the why. Without an understanding of this country underpinned by principles of liberty, any understanding of civics is superficial at best. There are ways to correct these educational deficiencies, but doing so will be a team effort between parents, educators, and lawmakers.  Every governor and state superintendent should immediately set high standards for teaching civics, history, and how the two connect. These standards must be based on students� understanding of facts and principles. Any standard that measures students on their understanding of DEI, Critical Race Theory, or gender identity politics is not a measure of education but one of indoctrination. States must wring the wokeness out of their standards and thus out of their curricula. Every school board and district leader should, in close concert with parents and teachers, figure out the best way to bring students to meet these new and improved standards of learning.  Parents, yet again, must step up where schools have failed. The responsibility to raise good citizens will always lie with America�s moms and dads. They can outsource that task to schools, but they can never abdicate it. This fastest and best fix for this problem, like so many others, will happen around millions of kitchen tables. As President Ronald Reagan said, \"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.\" We owe it to the next generation to teach them how to be thoughtful, productive, and informed citizens, so that they can write the next chapter of the great American story.

Of course, it�s a good idea to eat a nutrient-dense diet year-round � but this month, here are some foods that are especially a boon for your cardiovascular health. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Moreover, the cost of treating cardiovascular via health care services and other medicines is approximately hundreds of billions per year. Hundreds of thousands of individuals die from heart disease annually, with one person dying every 34 seconds, according to the CDC. Some of the leading lifestyle factors for the disease include obesity, lack of physical exercise and an unhealthy diet. SHOULD YOU RAISE YOUR CHILD AS A VEGAN OR A VEGETARIAN? NUTRITIONISTS WEIGH IN Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and other foods, such as poultry, are the backbone of a healthy diet to avoid cardiovascular illness. In early February, across the United States, individuals wear red on National Wear Red Day to highlight the importance of combating heart disease.  1. Dark leafy greens  It�s time to load up on spinach, kale, collard greens and other dark, leafy greens. This recommendation comes from Isa Kujawski, MPH, RDN, founder of Mea Nutrition LLC, who after serving for over 10 years of active duty in the Navy and losing her veteran brother to suicide dedicated her career to helping people use food as medicine. \"Dark leafy greens are a powerhouse of beneficial nutrients, including fiber, micronutrients and bioactive plant compounds known as phytochemicals,\" said Kujawski, citing a 2018 scientific review paper published in Nutrients. THESE ARE THE WORST FOODS FOR YOUR HEALTH, EXPERTS SAY \"These nutrients presumably protect against cardiovascular disease by various mechanisms, including altering gene expression, regulating blood pressure, and lowering inflammation in the body,\" she added. \"Myriad studies have demonstrated the association between intake of dark leafy greens and lower risk of cardiovascular disease.\" 2. Olive oil Erin Kenney, MS, RD, LDN, HCP, CPT, registered dietitian and CEO of Nutrition Rewired, is all about incorporating olive oil to your diet to keep your ticker happy. \"Olive oil consumption, specifically the extra-virgin, is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals at high cardiovascular risk,\" she said. A STRESSFUL MARRIAGE MAY HARM YOUR HEART HEALTH, STUDY FINDS \"Olive oil is rich in healthful antioxidants, polyphenols and vitamins, and is a good source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats,\" she continued, adding that to get the most benefits from olive oil, avoid heating the oil and instead use it in a salad or add it to a homemade hummus. EAT THESE FOODS TO LIVE A LONG LIFE, EXPERTS SAY 3. Avocados In case you needed another excuse to eat more guacamole, here it is. Avocados are high in monounsaturated fats, according to Amy Adams, RDN, LDN. \"Monounsaturated fats increase our LDL (�bad� cholesterol) clearance rate, meaning our body gets rid of them faster. Higher LDL levels can be detrimental because LDL brings cholesterol to the heart,\" she explained. \"One study done by the Journal of the American Heart Association found that overweight/obese individuals who consumed more avocados had the ability to significantly lower their LDL cholesterol when compared to overweight/obese individuals who ate a low-fat or moderate-fat diet.\" OLIVE OIL CAN CUT RISK OF DISEASE, HELP YOU LIVE LONGER, STUDY SAYS Echoing Adams, Kenney said that adding an avocado to your daily diet may help lower bad cholesterol, in turn reducing risk for heart disease, according to health researchers at Penn State. \"Avocado contains healthy monounsaturated fats in addition to potassium and magnesium, both of which help to maintain a healthy blood pressure,\" she said. 4. Berries \"Berries, such as blueberries, blackberries and raspberries are high in fiber, antioxidants and phytonutrients, all of which work to lower oxidative stress and inflammation in the body,\" said Kujawski, pointing to a 2010 study in Nutrition Reviews. \"These processes improve blood pressure, vascular function, and fight free radical formation. Consequently, clinical studies have shown that berries contribute to lower cardiovascular disease risk.\" \"Blueberries have been singled out as being a standout food when it comes to improving heart health.\" Kristi Ruth, RD, LDN, Carrotsandcookies.com, stressed the importance of eating more fresh fruits and vegetables in general to improve heart health. \"This will increase your intake of fiber and a variety of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and more,\" she said. \"Still, blueberries have been singled out as being a standout food when it comes to improving heart health,\" she continued, noting they are high in antioxidants, including anthocyanin, which is a flavonoid, a group of phytonutrients or plant chemicals that are incredible for heart health. 5. Beans   \"Beans are a heart healthy food which consist of fiber and a variety of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. They improve the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol, blood pressure, inflammation, and promoting digestive wellness,\" said Kujawski, highlighting research published in the peer-reviewed journal Nutrients. \"Beans are rich in soluble fiber, which acts as food to beneficial gut bacteria to promote a healthy gut flora, which is an important factor in overall heart health.\"  Adams is also all in for Team Bean. \"Beans contain plant sterols/stanols. Plant sterols/stanols work as active compounds in our body that are very similar in structure to cholesterol,\" she explained. \"Consequently, plant sterols/stanols compete with cholesterol for absorption in the small intestine. Overall, this causes less cholesterol to build up in our bloodstream. One study showed that eating 2-4 grams of plant sterols/stanols per day can reduce cholesterol by 10%.\" 6. Salmon  \"Salmon contains omega-3 fats which have been shown to significantly reduce the risk for sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias and all-cause mortality in patients with known coronary heart disease,\" said Kenney. \"These essential fats help by reducing inflammation in the body. If you don\'t like salmon, you may get the same benefits from a supplement based on a meta analysis that found fish oil omega3 supplements lowered risk for heart attack and death from coronary heart disease.\" Kenney recommended aiming for two to three servings of salmon or other high-fat fish, like herring, anchovies or mackerel, per week. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER 7. Whole grains Think barley, oatmeal, brown rice, millet, whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, and more. \"While refined carbohydrates get a bad reputation for their negative impact on health and increased risk of heart disease, whole grains have the opposite impact,\" said Kristin Gillespie, MS, RD, LD, adviser for Exercisewithstyle.com. \"These grains, which are incredibly nutritious as they contain all parts of the grain, are heart protective. Many studies have demonstrated a relationship between whole grain consumption and heart health.\" 8. Grapes  \"Grape skins contain resveratrol, a powerful polyphenol. Polyphenols are compounds found in plants, which have been shown to benefit the human body. More specifically, resveratrol is part of the stilbenoid family. Stilbenoids are a natural compound produced by certain plants in response to injury. The purpose of stilbenoids is to protect the plant,\" said Adams. \"Similarly, resveratrol has been shown to protect the cardiovascular system,\" Adams added. \"Several studies have determined that heart disease can be linked to oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial damage. Resveratrol has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, stimulate endothelial production of nitric oxide, and inhibit vascular inflammation.\" FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS 9. Walnuts These crunchy, mildly sweet nuts are a boon for heart health. \"Out of all nuts, walnuts are special because they have the highest percent of omega 6, omega 3, and polyunsaturated fats which are cardioprotective,\" said Adams. \"One study done by The New England Journal of Medicine evaluated whether walnuts consumption affected lipid levels and blood pressure. During the study, 18 healthy men in two different diets, with one group having 20% of their calories coming from walnuts. Each diet was followed for a total of four weeks. In conclusion, participants consuming more walnuts reduced total levels of cholesterol by 12.4%, reduced LDL (or �bad� cholesterol) by 16.3%.\" Walnuts are also a research-backed food to support cognition and brain health. 10. Flaxseed Flaxsed is \"one of the richest plant sources of omega-3 fat(ALA), which is excellent for heart health,\" said Ruth, citing research in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology. She also commented that flaxseed is high in fiber and lignans (a phytochemical), and that both of those things are thought to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Thanks to the fiber content, flaxseed is helpful with digestion, too.','Perri Blumberg\r'),('American homeowners worry most about these three things','2023-04-18T12:22:33-04:00','Not Found!','Rising mortgage rates are eroding the fortunes of a growing number of homeowners, but it&apos;s not the only challenge they are facing in the current housing market, a recent report said. Negative equity was a top concern for 56% of Americans, according to the&#xA0;2023 Insuring the American Homeowner report&#xA0;by Insurify. Overall, 24% of homeowners said that rising mortgage rates and dropping home values meant they now owed more on their mortgage than the current home value. The highest share (31%) of underwater mortgages were from Americans that purchased a home one to three years ago and 27% of the upside-down loans were from those who bought their homes less than a year ago.&#xA0; Additionally, nearly 45% of respondents said climate change had already affected the values of their homes, and 76% felt that it would be a problem in the future.&#xA0; These homeownership challenges are also behind the growing cost of&#xA0;home insurance premiums. Home insurance rates are projected to increase another 9%, following a 7% increase from the previous year, according to Insurify. &quot;The cost of individual policies is rising,&quot; Insurify&apos;s Vice President of Insurance Sales Shawn Powers said in a statement. &quot;Homeowners may notice an increase of hundreds of dollars from one year to the next. &quot;This may induce homeowners to shop around with multiple companies for a policy,&quot; Powers continued. &quot;While this is a great way to find a better price, homeowners may find their current carrier is not alone in raising rates.&quot; If you have a mortgage, you&apos;re typically required to carry homeowners insurance, but you don&apos;t have to stick with any particular insurance company.

HOME PRICES SLOW AGAIN, BUT BANKING SECTOR WOES MAKE IT HARDER TO GET A MORTGAGE: CASE-SHILLER  Climate change risk is one of the main reasons highlighted in the report as to why insurance premiums are rising. The impact depends on a homeowner&apos;s specific risk profile, measured by the Federal Emergency Management Agency&apos;s (FEMA) risk index score, which is scaled from zero to 100. Homeowners may be paying an extra $24 in annual home insurance premiums for every point increase, according to Insurify. &quot;Mortgage lenders are only just beginning to ingest climate risk data,&quot; Sam Eckhouse, Principal of ClimateCheck, told Insurify. &quot;SEC-proposed climate risk disclosures and anticipated climate risk assessment guidelines from ASTM [the American Society for Testing and Materials] are helping drive adoption.&#xA0; &quot;Ultimately, that data will influence lending and thereby home prices &#x2014; but we&apos;re not seeing the impact just yet,&quot; Eckhouse continued. Inflation&#xA0;and rising home prices are also impacting the cost of home insurance, according to a recent Policygenius&#xA0;survey. Inflation has driven the costs of building up, affecting the cost of home repairs after a disaster. Home prices have also made significant gains in the last year, so the cost of replacing them has also increased.

HOME PRICES COULD DROP THROUGH 2023: ZILLOW  Despite the increasing impact that climate change may have on homeowner insurance costs, 89% of homeowners said they were confident their home insurance policy would meet their needs, according to the report. Almost 98% said they were at least moderately confident that their insurer would resolve their claim satisfactorily. More than half (65%) said that they had filed a claim in the past.

Charles Q. Brown Jr., as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as Army Gen. Mark Milley\'s four-year term approaches its end. If nominated and confirmed by the Senate, Brown, who currently serves as the chief of staff of the Air Force, would become the second black man in the position. Army Gen. Colin Powell, who was appointed to the post by former President George H.W. Bush in 1989, was the first. Though Brown was long expected to become the 21st Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Biden also interviewed Gen. David Berger, the 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Wall Street Journal reported. Brown\'s expected nomination was first reported Thursday by Politico, the WSJ said. SENATE CONFIRMS CHARLES BROWN AS AIR FORCE CHIEF OF STAFF, MAKING HIM FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN SERVICE CHIEF  Though the chairmanship does not follow a strict rotation between branches, it was unlikely that another Army general would be nominated to succeed Milley. It also appeared to be unlikely that a sailor would be nominated for the position since the current Joint Chiefs vice chairman is Navy Admiral Christopher Grady. As expected, the White House and defense officials have been quiet on Brown\'s potential nomination, releasing limited details in statements to media outlets. \"When President Biden makes a final decision, he will inform the person selected and then announce it publicly,\" the White House said via the WSJ. \"That hasn�t happened yet.\" If confirmed, Brown would be sworn into office on Oct. 1, the day after Milley\'s term ends.

Since March, three major banks � First Republic Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank which had assets worth $212 billion, $209 billion and $110 billion, respectively, according to Federal Reserve data � have imploded in the wake of high interest rates and poor management decisions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has estimated its actions to resolve the failures will cost taxpayers about $36 billion. \"The Federal Reserve, the Treasury, this entire administration, frankly, has been very inconsistent with their operations in financial markets,\" E.J. Antoni, an economist and research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"So they will do one thing in one instance and then something completely different in the next.\" \"However, if this last episode is any indication, as the federal government gets increasingly desperate in this banking crisis, as the crisis continues to escalate, what we\'re seeing is an increasing willingness to basically use taxpayer money to bail out these institutions,\" Antoni added. TECH CEO WITH MILLIONS IN SILICON VALLEY BANK: \'INNOVATION IN THE STARTUP WORLD IS BLEEDING TODAY\'  On Monday, the FDIC announced that JPMorgan Chase would pay the agency $10.6 billion to take control of most First Republic assets, but that the move would cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund about $13 billion. That federally-managed fund was created in the 1930s to provide a backstop in the event of major bank failures. The March failure of Silicon Valley Bank cost the Deposit Insurance Fund $20 billion and the collapse of Signature bank shortly thereafter cost the fund about $3 billion. FED REPORT ON SILICON VALLEY BANK COLLAPSE BLAMES MISMANAGEMENT, WEAK GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT \"Normally we would see larger banks acquiring these regional banks because they\'re a good deal right now,\" Thomas Hogan, a senior research faculty at the American Institute for Economic Research and former chief economist on the Senate Banking Committee, said in an interview. \"Now that they\'ve seen the government is willing to provide assistance, they\'re going to wait until the banks are basically failed and then the government\'s willing to provide some bailout package in order to make that acquisition possible,\" Hogan said. \"That definitely is what happened with First Republic and JPMorgan Chase.\" \"It\'s a bad incentive. The precedent they\'ve set is going to make private banks less willing to acquire or bail out these failing institutions.\"  According to Hogan, at least four regional banks are also facing significant market pressures. First Horizon Bank, PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance all saw their share price plummet during trading on Thursday. Hogan, Antoni and Stephen Moore, a senior economist at FreedomWorks, largely blamed the bank failures on interest rate hikes that the Federal Reserve has pursued over the last year. FIRST REPUBLIC BANK SHARES NOSEDIVE AMID UNCERTAINTY ABOUT RESCUE DEAL \"A lot of these banks hold government bonds that are now worth � they\'ve dropped in value by about 30% because of the huge interest rate spike over the last year. So, their balance sheets look horrible now because of some of the Fed actions,\" Moore told Fox News Digital. \"The reason the Fed had to take those actions was because we had this extraordinary spending spree,\" he added. \"You had a completely indefensible spending spree after COVID was over. Then you had prices rise. Inflation went to 9%. And then you had the Fed forced to respond to that by this almost unprecedentedly rapid interest rate rises.\" On March 11, 2021, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, his signature $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package that was criticized at the time as unnecessary given the pandemic\'s progress. Since then, year-over-year inflation has worsened from 2.6% to a more than four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, but has come down to 5% as of March. The slowed inflation rate rise has been coupled by rapid Federal Reserve rate hikes, from near-zero 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% this month.  The Federal Reserve was widely criticized for maintaining extremely low pandemic-era interest rates for too long. \"When you force financial institutions to hunt for yield � which is exactly what they did by putting rates to zero and keeping them there for so long � you\'re also forcing banks to take increasingly leveraged positions,\" Antoni said. \"In other words, instead of just keeping a relatively large percent of deposits on hand because they can easily make money in relatively safe investments, they now have to take virtually all deposits and put virtually all of them into very risky positions,\" he continued. \"So, again, it\'s an increase in leverage that didn\'t have to happen. And now this is all coming home to roost.\" Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and White House have stated that the banking system is safe in an attempt to assuage fears.  \"I�m going to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen the rules for banks to make it less likely that this kind of bank failure will happen again and to protect American jobs and small businesses.

Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation�s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture. Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today. BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE The theme for February is \"Black Resistance,\" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U.S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today. Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years. 1. Sojourner Truth Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York � where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports. Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court. BLACK HISTORY MONTH FACTS: 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner. Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women�s rights, and religious tolerance. Baumfree famously delivered her \"Ain�t I a Woman?\" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women�s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen�s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book \"The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave\" (1850). 2. Frederick Douglass  Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland. He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress. Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his \"What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?\" speech (1852) and \"Life and Times of Frederick Douglass\" autobiography (1881). BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment. 3. Harriet Tubman   Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross. She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished. Tubman personally made \"about 13 trips into Maryland\" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to \"about 70 more.\" Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made \"about 13 trips into Maryland\" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to \"about 70 more,\" according to the NPS. By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group�s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid. 4. George Washington Carver  Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri. While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865. Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor\'s and master\'s of science degree. YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE Carver�s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports. Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college. 5. Ida B. Wells American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation. Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports. Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. Wells went on to write expos�s about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women�s suffrage. Some of her famous written works include \"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases\" (1893) and \"Mob Rule in New Orleans\" (1900). Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931. 6. W. E. B. Du Bois American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America�s Library reports. He then earned a second bachelor�s degree, a master\'s and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke. Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America�s oldest and largest civil rights organization. Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including \"Black Reconstruction in America,\" \"The Souls of Black Folk\" and \"The Talented Tenth.\" Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America�s oldest and largest civil rights organization. The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that \"builds Black political power to end structural racism.\" 7. Thurgood Marshall  Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore. He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports. From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights. THURGOOD MARSHALL: EXPLORING HIS LIFE Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were \"separate but equal.\" Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases. His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.  President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court � where he served as a justice until 1991. 8. Rosa Parks   Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports. At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn�t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow. The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service�s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time. The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute. She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991. 9. Shirley Chisholm  Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill. In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U.S. House of Representatives reports. Chisholm earned a bachelor\'s degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master\'s in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director and educational consultant before entering politics. Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn�s Bedford-Stuyvesantdistrict for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party\'s nomination for president. 10. Martin Luther King Jr.  Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws. He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America�s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality. King delivered his most famous speech, \"I Have a Dream,\" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER King\'s notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance. However, it showed the world the assaults that African Americans faced during peaceful protests through photos and video.','Cortney Moore\r'),('BMW issues \'do not drive\' warning for older models with recalled airbags that may explode','2023-05-05T09:17:15-04:00','Not Found!','BMW has issued a &quot;do not drive&quot; warning to the owners of about 90,000 older models in the U.S. because of defective airbags that might explode in a crash. The affected vehicles are 2000-2006 model years that have been recalled before due to known issues with Takata-manufactured airbag inflators. However, BMW decided to escalate previous recall notices to a &quot;Do Not Drive&quot; order because the affected vehicles have not been brought in for repairs.&#xA0; &quot;Owners of affected BMWs that have not had their vehicles inspected and repaired should not consider them safe to drive,&quot; BMW said. The order affects the 2000-2006 BMW 3 Series (E46) models including M3, 2000-2003 5 Series (E39) including M5, and 2000-2004 X5s (E53).  Takata&apos;s airbag inflators used volatile ammonium nitrate to inflate the airbags in a crash. However, the chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to heat and humidity and blow apart a metal canister, hurling shrapnel that can injure or kill drivers and passengers. STELLANTIS, BMW IN TALKS WITH PANASONIC OVER NEW EV BATTERY PLANTS  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Thursday that owners of affected BMW models should park their cars immediately and contact BMW for more information. &quot;If you have a model year 2000-2006 BMW with a recalled Takata airbag, get it repaired immediately &#x2013; for free. These inflators are two decades old now and, with every day that passes, they become even more dangerous as they can rupture even in a minor crash,&quot; NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said in a statement. BMW SALES RECOVER IN FOURTH QUARTER AS SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES EASE  Since 2009, the exploding airbags made by Takata have killed at least 33 people worldwide, including 24 in the United States. Most of the deaths and about 400 injuries have happened in U.S., but they also have occurred in Australia and Malaysia. BMW emphasized that replacement parts are available, and the repairs will be done free of charge. The company said that remote technicians can be sent to wherever the vehicle is located and repairs can be completed on site, typically in under an hour. If remote repair is not available for a customer with an affected vehicle, BMW will have the car picked up at the customer&apos;s home or office free of charge, repaired and returned when the service is complete. HONDA OWNERS WITH OLDER MODELS ADVISED TO PARK UNTIL &#x2018;DANGEROUS&#x2019; AIR BAGS ARE REPLACED  &quot;We cannot state strongly enough just how urgent it is for our customers to take this warning seriously. We know these airbags only become more dangerous over time, which is why we are taking yet another step to get these parts out of our vehicles. Customers must park these vehicles immediately and take a few moments to check if their vehicle is safe for them and their family members to drive&quot;, said Claus Eberhart, vice president of Aftersales BMW NA.&#xA0; &quot;Repairing these vehicles is quick, easy to arrange, and is completely free of charge,&quot; Eberhart added.

The new documents reveal his desk was completely empty. In the apartment, police found hair samples, fabric with dark red stains and a single black glove and other evidence. Police seized a single \"nitrite-type black glove,\" a Walmart receipt and Dickies tag, two receipts from a Marshalls store, the dust container from a Bissell vacuum, eight \"possible hair strands,\" a Fire TV stick, a single \"possible animal hair strand,\" four other \"possible\" hairs and a computer tower.

The saga began when Mulvaney publicized that thebeer companysent packs of Bud Light featuring the influencer�s face as a way to celebrate a full year of \"girlhood.\" Mulvaney said the cans were her \"most prized possession\" on Instagram with a post that featured \"#budlightpartner.\"The backlash was swift and parent company Anheuser-Busch has been faced with plummeting sales as a result, losing some $5 billion in market value. \"In my career, and from what I\'ve seen, this is by far been one of the most polarizing instances within the social media space,\" Viral Nation marketing strategist Emma Ferrara told Fox News Digital. Ferrara believes Bud Light should have approached the attempt to reach the transgender community, or new customers of any kind, more strategically.  BUD LIGHT IN �SERIOUS TROUBLE� OF LOSING STATUS AS TOP-SELLING BEER IN US, INDUSTRY EXPERT WARNS \"When you\'re looking to connect with a new community, which I think is incredibly important, I think there is a right and wrong way to approach that. And it starts with understanding who your core audience is,\" she said. \"It starts with also understanding who is your brand and what are your values and what\'s your purpose.\" Ferrara feels Bud Light should have figured out how to connect its once-loyal consumer base with the community it was trying to reach, which the beer making seemingly failed to do. Once-proud consumers across America were outraged that Bud Light celebrated a full year of \"girlhood\" with a transgendered person, which has emerged as one of the most polarizing issues in America. Many have scolded Bud Light over the partnership, with everything from blue collar Americans boycotting the product to conservative rock star Kid Rock using severalBud Lightcases for target practice. Ferrara thinks Bud Light would have been better off bringing in a \"real, authentic and credible fan of Bud Light\" within the transgender community if it wanted to reach that demographic, as Mulvaney didn�t feel like an authentic consumer of the product. \"Brands need to be aware that the transgender community is not a monolith, and individuals within that community have, you know, many different experiences and perspectives and identities,\" Ferrara said. \"That means brands need to conduct thorough research and gain a deep understanding of the nuances within that community. And as well, I think there should have been some steps to really understand their current community and how they feel around that topic.\" BUD LIGHT�S PACT WITH TRANS ACTIVIST DYLAN MULVANEY SPARKS OUTRAGE, PRAISE  The Bud Light situation has been at the forefront of the cultural zeitgeist for over a month, and has been a fixture among conservative talking points in recent weeks. \"This very much ties back to the notion that not all publicity is good publicity,\" Ferrara said. Things have gotten so ugly that Anheuser-Busch�sCEO Michel Doukeris addressed the ordeal on an earnings call with investors on Thursday. He downplayed the brand\'s partnership, and insisted there is \"misinformation\" spreading on social media about the company\'s team-up with Mulvaney. \"We need to clarify the facts that this was one can, one influencer, one post and not a campaign,\" Doukeris said, noting that the company has provided \"direct financial support\" to the frontline workers impacted by the boycott, naming delivery drivers, sales representatives, wholesalers, bar owners and servers. CEO DISTANCES ANHEUSER-BUSCH FROM BUD LIGHT DYLAN MULVANEY CONTROVERSY: \'NOT A FORMAL CAMPAIGN\'  Ferrara thinks Doukeris� comments missed the mark. \"I really am of the belief that there is no such thing as a small post, or one post, or diminishing the meaning behind that. I do believe that there was an effort to connect with the community and one that, I think, just came about in the wrong way because it was inauthentic, and it wasn\'t credible,\" she said. \"When we think about the social space and when we think about partnerships and when we think about diverse groups and creators, including those from the transgender community, I think it\'s really important for brands to take a step back to ensure that they\'re relevant, they\'re authentic and they\'re credible in regard to the brand�s need to really develop a thoughtful and nuanced strategy around this,\" Ferrara continued. \"I think it\'s important that you have the right experts to help you navigate and understand what is the best way to meaningfully connect, and is it even the right community to connect to?\" During Thursday�s call, Doukerissaid it was too early to tell how the boycott affected Bud Light sales but was bullish thatAnheuser-Busch will quickly recoverfrom any setback. He reminded investors that the company has navigated global challenges including temporary bans on beer sales in certain countries and shutdowns of bars and restaurants across the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic.   The backlash has also led Bud Light toshake up its marketing team.

The ruling was filed last week and is the first decision since the U.S. Supreme Court limited California\'s ability to regulate firearms, Fox San Francisco reported.

The ruling also upheld the conviction of Alex Bocanegra, a San Jose man who was charged with attempted murder when he used an assault rifle to shoot at a former friend.  California has taken strict measures to limit the use of assault weapons. Gov. Gavin Newsom has endorsed tighter gun control measures following a string of mass shootings in the state earlier this year. He supported legislation that would ban people from carrying guns into churches, public libraries, zoos, amusement parks, playgrounds, banks and other privately-owned businesses that are open to the public. The rule wouldn\'t apply if the business owner puts up a sign that says concealed guns are allowed. \"Gun safety saves lives,\" Newsom said at a February news conference to announce the proposed bill. \"More guns, more lives lost.\" Many gun owners believe they should be able to own firearms, especially for protection.   \"For protection, for self-protection.

Intuit agreed to the payout a year ago after a multi-state investigation led by the New York Attorney General&apos;s Office determined that the company deceived consumers by advertising free services that were not free to everyone. Intuit did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.   Under the terms of the settlement, Intuit agreed to suspend TurboTax&apos;s &quot;free, free, free&quot; ad campaign and provide restitution to nearly 4.4 million consumers who used TurboTax&apos;s Free Edition for tax years 2016 through 2018. Impacted customers will automatically receive a direct payment of approximately $30 for each year that they paid for tax filing services that were advertised as free. IRS PLANS TO HIRE GUN-CARRYING SPECIAL AGENTS IN ALL 50 STATES New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday that the checks will be sent out beginning next week and throughout May. &quot;TurboTax&#x2019;s predatory and deceptive marketing cheated millions of low-income Americans who were trying to fulfill their legal duties to file their taxes,&quot; James said in a statement.  &quot;Today we are righting that wrong and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking taxpayers who should have never paid to file their taxes,&quot; she continued. &quot;I thank my fellow attorneys general for their partnership in this effort to stand up for ordinary Americans and hold companies who cheat consumers accountable.&quot; Up until July 2021, TurboTax allowed taxpayers earning up to roughly $34,000 and members of the military to file their taxes for free through the IRS Free filing program. In exchange for participating in the program, the IRS agreed not to compete with Intuit and other tax-prep companies by providing its own electronic tax preparation and filing services. IRS HAS SPENT $10 MILLION ON &#x2018;WEAPONRY AND GEAR&#x2019; SINCE START OF CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, REPORT SAYS Intuit also offers a free edition of TurboTax for taxpayers with &quot;simple returns.&quot; However, the New York Attorney General&apos;s Office says the aggressively marketed &quot;freemium&quot; product is only free for approximately one-third of U.S. taxpayers. In comparison, the IRS&apos; Free File products are free for approximately 70% of taxpayers. The investigation was sparked by a 2019 ProPublica report that claimed that Intuit executives knew they were deceiving customers. &quot;The website lists &#x2018;Free, Free, Free,&#x2019; and the customers are assuming their return will be free,&quot; an internal company PowerPoint presentation reportedly said. &quot;Customers are getting upset.&quot;  After reaching the settlement, which was signed on to by all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Intuit Executive Vice President and General Counsel Kerry McLean said in a blog post at the time that the company was &quot;pleased to have reached a resolution with the state attorneys general that will ensure the company can return our focus to providing vital services to American taxpayers today and in the future.&quot; GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE &quot;Intuit is clear and fair with its customers, including with the nearly 100 million Americans who filed their taxes free of charge with our products over the last eight years &#x2013; more than all other tax prep software companies combined,&quot; McLean wrote. &quot;In coming to a resolution on this matter, we admitted no wrongdoing and are pleased to be able to continue our strong partnership with governments to best serve the needs of taxpayers across the country.&quot; Former FOX Business reporter Lucas Manfredi&apos;s previous reporting contributed to this story.','Breck Dumas\r'),('Chicago prep school\'s \'negligent behavior\' toward cyberbullying led to student\'s suicide, parents allege','2023-05-05T11:22:08-04:00','Not Found!','This story may contain details that are disturbing. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. In January 2022, Robert and Rose Bronstein\'s 15-year-old son died by suicide after The Latin School of Chicago allegedly ignored the teenager\'s complaints about bullying on social media from his peers. The Bronsteins allege that the school never notified them after their son, Nate, went to school staff with concerns about the bullying he was being subject to on apps like Snapchat about a month prior to his death. ELITE US BOARDING SCHOOL ADMITS FAILURE TO HALT BULLYING THAT LED TO STUDENT\'S SUICIDE \"Their first instinct, their second instinct and third instinct was to protect themselves and their careers. They could literally care less about the truth,\" Robert Bronstein said of the school, which he claimed acted with \"cruelty and the callousness\" before and after their son\'s death. Issues at school Prior to his suicide, the school\'s dean of students allegedly contacted the Bronsteins to tell them Nate had been put on notice for not wearing his mask correctly over his nose.  The same dean of students, however, apparently failed to contact the Bronsteins when their son was being bullied, according to their lawsuit against the school. The Bronsteins enrolled Nate, whom they described as a \"bright\" and \"energetic\" boy with an intense love for sports, at The Latin School of Chicago as a sophomore in the fall of 2021. UNDERCOVER MOTHER: CHICAGO MOTHER SUING LATIN SCHOOL FOR $100M SAYS IT VALUED REPUTATION OVER SAVING HER SON He had spent the last year online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and his parents wanted him to go back to in-person learning, which The Latin School, founded in 1888, promised parents. But when Nate started school, he was apparently subject to rumors that he had enrolled during his sophomore year \"for nefarious reasons,\" Rose Bronstein said.  Students wondered why he was there, whether he was a problem child, whether he had been kicked out of his last school or expelled � none of which is true, Rose said. \"They spread rumors that he was unvaccinated, which, of course, at the time was like �The Scarlet Letter,�\" she explained. CHICAGO PARENTS DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY FROM SCHOOL AFTER SON\'S SUICIDE: BULLYING �WAS KEPT FROM US� The Bronsteins had already made plans for Nate to transfer schools by the end of the spring semester after hearing about the harassment their son had been enduring, but by January it was too late. Cyberbullying The bullying allegedly got worst after Nate joined the school basketball team. Most of the bullying took place online via social media apps including Snapchat, which allows messages to disappear after 24 hours or immediately after users open them.  In a group chat with about 20 of his basketball teammates, included in the lawsuit, other players told Nate, \"[D]on�t show up tomorrow,\" and called him a \"snake ass n****.\" Theyalso insinuated that they would physically harm the 15-year-old when they saw him, according to the family\'s lawyers. Additionally, a widely circulated Snapchat message called Nate \"a terrible person.\" A student also apparently saw a Snapchat that told Nate: \"[G]o kill yourself.\" ADRIANA KUCH DEATH: NJ PARENTS, STUDENTS ERUPT AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETING AFTER BULLIED TEEN\'S SUICIDE The family sued the school for $100 million in damages, alleging that Bridget Hennessy, the Dean of Students for the 9th and 10th grades, had failed to take action or notfiy them after Nate had brought the online harassment to her attention, despite having a legal duty to be a \"mandated reporter\" under Illinois state law. Days after Nate\'s suicide, parents of other students apparently went to the members of The Latin School administration, including Head of Students Randall Dunn, to show evidence of the bullying Nate had endured on social media, the lawsuit states. The complaint alleges that the school did not disclose that evidence to the Bronsteins until Jan. 27, 2022 � about two weeks after Nate\'s suicide. Dunn, head of the Board of Trustees of the National Association of Independent Schools, has since taken on a new role as the head of Rye Country Day � a similar elite private school in a New York City suburb. He did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital.  \"January 13th was the most horrific day of our lives. And to me, January 27, when we found out what had happened, it was like reliving that trauma all over again. It was absolutely shocking,\" Rose said. The Latin School did not return a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Cyberbullying is the second-largest discipline issue across U.S. schools today � more than double what it was over the past decade, according to the Department of Education. NEW JERSEY SCHOOL SUICIDE: MOTHER OF 11-YEAR-OLD DISCOVERS OMINOUS PHONE RECORDING Teens and adolescents who are subject to cyberbullying are also four times more likely to inclfict self-harm or attempt to or commit suicide, a 2022 study by researchers ShayArnon, AnatBrunstein Klomek and ElinaVisoki found. Social media and private schools The Bronsteins have since tried to turn their anger and grief into awareness for other parents through their nonprofit, Buckets Over Bullying, which aims to \"help prevent other families from enduring similar tragedy by the loss of a child in the same way.\"  First, they want parents to be aware that their children may be subject to, or participating in, cyberbullying on social media. The Bronsteinsbelieve that cyber-safety education should be a course in schools in the same way that health and physical education are. UTAH STUDENT AT �WORLD CLASS� BOARDING SCHOOL DIES OF SEPSIS AFTER COMPLAINTS WERE IGNORED: LAWYER \"Parents should demand that schools employ the resources of very specialized experts in the area, because it is specialized, and it\'s changing incredibly quickly,\" Rose Bronstein said. Parents give their children iPhones and iPads at young ages assuming they are watching funny videos or playing harmless games, when in reality, they are exposed to \"violent acts online, hate speech [and] threats\" until \"they become . . . desensitized to it.\"  Additionally, parents need to be aware that private schools are held to different standards from those of public schools, they said. Their son\'s suicide is comparable to the recentdeath of Jack Reid of The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. Reid, 17, died in a dorm on campus, which is situated just outside of Trenton, on April 30, 2022, after he had endured \"bullying and other forms of cruel behavior\" at the boarding and day school. CHICAGO TEEN KILLED HIMSELF AFTER BULLYING WHILE ELITE SCHOOL TURNED A �BLIND EYE,\' LAWSUIT CLAIMS The difference, according to the Bronsteins, is that The Lawrenceville School conducted an independent investigation into Reid\'s death and posted a statement on its website as part of a settlement with the Reid family. The Latin School of Chicago has not done the same for the Bronsteins, the family said. \"They worked overtime to see that we never heard about it and hoped that it would go away,\" Rose alleged. \"They immediately removed our names from the directory. . . . They worked very hard to hope that what happened would never come up.\" \"It\'s arrogance, it\'s selfishness, and it\'s disrespectful,\" said Robert.  \"This is about our children. We send our children to school every day under the assumption that the adults in these schools are going to keep our kids safe, especially private school . . . when you\'re paying $40, $50, $60, $70,000 a year. As a parent, you assume you are paying this money because your child . . . is in good hands,\" Rose said. There is a \"higher level\" of \"egregious negligent behavior\" within the private school system, because school officials make a more significant effort to cover up concerns, Rose continued.  \"They\'re failing our children. They\'re pushing parents out. And with the Lawrence situation, [the Reid family] said that they were not notified . . . about some of the bullying that went on with their son. So, these school parents who are at private schools � we need we demand transparency about reports of bullying and cyberbullying that involve our children. And we\'re not getting it,\" she said. The Bronsteins are accepting donations to various organizations combating cyberbullying and promoting other educational opportunities through their website, BucketsOverBullying.com.','Audrey Conklin\r'),('Chicago reporter issues dire warning after being barred entry to luxury migrant hotel: \'Ticking time bomb\'','2023-05-05T09:00:00-04:00','Media','A Chicago reporter issued a stark warning on public safety after employees working at a luxury hotel housing migrants barred him from entering during a heated exchange caught on camera. William Kelly spoke with workers at the Inn of Chicago, requesting additional information about the status of the hotel, but the employees quickly told him it was closed and he was not welcome because he wasn\'t a \"resident\" at the hotel. Kelly recounted the \"hostile\" exchange with the individuals on \"Fox &amp; Friends First\" and his broader concerns surrounding how using the hotel as a migrant facility could impact the Windy City\'s already-rampant crime. REPORTER TO CHICAGO\'S LIGHTFOOT: HOW CAN YOU �POSSIBLY EVEN CONSIDER� RE-ELECTION AFTER �HARM YOU�VE CAUSED\' \"It is very disturbing,\" Kelly told co-host Ashley Strohmier Friday. \"This is right off of Michigan Avenue. We already have the retailers fleeing due to violent crime. Tourists obviously have flatlined in the city of Chicago. Hotels are struggling, and this luxury hotel is apparently being used to house migrants.\" \"The city of Chicago isn\'t talking about this at all, so Chicago residents are being kept completely in the dark,\" he continued. \"We really have a ticking time bomb here, something� tragic could happen at the hotel. Something could spill out onto Michigan Avenue. We are entering Chicago\'s notorious murder season, and we already have an out-of-control crime problem. The police are understaffed, and our new mayor doesn\'t seem to have a plan.\"  The Chicago reporter caught the exchange on video after one worker told him the location was \"private.\" Kelly pressed the individuals, arguing the location was a hotel and he saw other people go inside, but one employee said \"you cannot come in,\" and after further dialogue said, \"It\'s closed for you.\" \"It\'s a private area, so therefore it\'s private,\" one person said. \"You\'re not a resident here.\" REPORTER WHO TANGLES WITH LORI LIGHTFOOT SUES AFTER PRESS PASS WAS REVOKED: �FIRST AMENDMENT ON LIFE SUPPORT\' Kelly said the hotel is completely closed to public. He said after speaking with migrants, he found that a majority of the individuals are from Venezuela. He was quick to note that under outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot\'s leadership specifically, the city housed the migrants for a steep price tag, all at the expense of the city\'s taxpayers. \"Mayor Lightfoot is saying that this is going to cost the taxpayers between 20 and $25 million a month,\" Kelly said. \"Where is this money going? There\'s never really, to my knowledge, been any accounting. We don\'t really even know how many migrants are at this hotel.\"  \"You can be sure that� if this hotel was just being run out for the public� there\'d be� city inspectors crawling all over this place to shut it down,\" he continued. \"But yet� as of right now, there\'s nobody, no one who isn\'t somehow running this very secretive operation, is even allowed inside the hotel.\"  Kelly\'s broader concern surrounding the run-in with employees at the Inn of Chicago stems from the lack of transparency surrounding the use of city tax dollars. \"The real questions that I have are the people who are in a very secretive way trying to corral these migrants, and also how quickly they turn hostile,\" Kelly said. \"That was the other thing that kind of shocked me was their attitude that Chicagoans almost have no right to know. They have no right to ask any questions, and the second I even asked my very first question before I even attempted to enter the hotel, they called 911.\" Kelly has been a longtime critic of Lightfoot, and the pair have a history of tussles surrounding crime in the Windy City. He accused her of revoking his press credentials in order to protect her now-failed re-election campaign. Some critics cite Chicago\'s crime record as what spurred her election loss.

There are a lot of misconceptions about the day and what it represents, in large part because the celebration has quite a different meaning in Mexico than the United States. Cinco de Mayo is not largely celebrated in Mexico and is not a federal holiday in the country. In fact, the day is much more celebrated in the United States. The United States\' Cinco de Mayo celebrations and traditions are very different compared to those in Mexico in many ways. First, the reason for celebrating differs between the two countries as well as how celebrations occur.  10 DRINKS TO ENJOY ON CINCO DE MAYO Read on for facts about Cinco de Mayo in the United States vs Mexico.  1. What does Cinco de Mayo represent in Mexico?  Cinco de Mayo is often confused with Mexican Independence Day, but the two are very different. In Mexico, Cinco de Mayo celebrates the country\'s victory over France during the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. RECIPES FROM THE PROS TO THROW A PERFECT CINCO DE MAYO PARTY  Mexican Independence Day, which takes place each year on Sept. 16, celebrates Mexico�s independence from Spain in 1810, according to NationalToday.com. 2. What does Cinco de Mayo represent in the United States? In the United States, Cinco de Mayo has become a day that celebrates Mexican culture. The holiday gained popularity in the U.S. in the 1960s, according to History.com. 3. How is Cinco de Mayo celebrated in Mexico? The rather ironic truth about Cinco de Mayo is that it really is not celebrated in Mexico, and it is a much bigger celebration in the U.S. The day is not a federal holiday in Mexico, so all businesses are open and operate as usual. For Mexico as a whole, it is a pretty minor holiday and throughout the country the natives in Puebla are typically the people who celebrate most.  HOW TO DECORATE YOUR HOME FOR CINCO DE MAYO In Puebla, there are often recreations of the Battle of Puebla and military parades in celebration of Cinco de Mayo. 4. How is Cinco de Mayo celebrated in the United States? In the United States, the Cinco de Mayo parties go late into the night. The day is celebrated with traditional Mexican food and drinks like tacos and margaritas. People all over the country dance to mariachi music, host enormous parties and throw packed parades. Cinco de Mayo celebrations occur in states all across the country, but especially in those with large Mexican-American populations.   Los Angeles is home to some of the biggest Cinco de Mayo events in the country including Fiesta Broadway. Cinco de Mayo is also commonly celebrated in Texas, especially in the south-central part of the state with the Fiesta San Antonio.

Sanders was brought in to bring winning back to a program that has won double-digit games just once since 2002.  But he�s done so by completely rebuilding the roster, with 57 players entering the transfer portal since Sanders became the head coach, according to a school spokesman. COLORADO BUFFALOES HAVE 18 PLAYERS ENTER TRANSFER PORTAL FOLLOWING SPRING GAME On Thursday, Colorado athletic director Rick George threw his support behind Sanders as he attempts to build a winner in Boulder. \"I have confidence in him and his staff, and they know what they\'re doing,\" George told ESPN following the Pac-12\'s spring meetings. \"He\'s been very honest and forthright. He\'s been very open about it publicly and privately. He\'s trying to build a winner at Colorado, and this is his way to do it.\" Sanders made it clear from the moment he stepped on campus that changes were coming to the program. In his first meeting with returning players, Sanders told them to \"go ahead and jump in that [transfer] portal\" as he was bringing players with him from Jackson State. While some players left the program voluntarily, the NCAA stipulates that first-year head coaches may cut players from the roster, though the university must honor the players\' scholarships.

We\'re not the first to do this. The NCAA rule says you can have those discussions. If a student-athlete wants to stay, they can stay. The university has to pay for them, they don\'t count on your scholarship limits, and they\'re not on the team.\" Sanders made headlines last week when offensive lineman Travis Gray revealed the way he was cut from the team.

And while some are questioning the way Sanders is going about rebuilding the roster, George fully supports Coach Prime. \"Coach is doing what he thinks is best for this program,\" George said. \"I support that.

Teachers also invited substitute teacher Kimberly Chambers, who is the executive director of the Supporting Pride Learning and Social Happenings (SPLASH) organization that \"seeks to educate school aged children on topics of sexuality and gender identity,\" to speak at one of the GSA meetings, which was attended by the Lee\'s sixth-grade daughter, according to the lawsuit. TRANS ACTOR WHO APPEARED IN BUD LIGHT COMMERCIAL DOESN\'T �BELIEVE IN THE ALLYSHIP OF ANHEUSER-BUSCH� Chambers reportedly \"told the children that if they are not completely comfortable in their bodies, that means that they are transgender,\" while speaking to the school club on May 4, 2021. The teacher also had children discuss what sex and gender they are attracted to and awarded students with \"LGBTQ paraphernalia such as toys, flags, and other swag\" if they \"came out\" as transgender. The teacher told students that there was \"a higher likelihood of suicide by transgender youth,\" but the Lee family said their daughter did not even fully understand what suicide was at the time. Chambers also repeatedly told students it \"might not be safe to tell their parents what happened at the GSA meeting or to talk about transgender issues\" and instead suggested they speak with her or other teachers. She offered students her phone number and told them to connect with her on Discord, so they could contact her at any time. The Lees were excited that their \"shy\" daughter was asked to get involved in school activities because she had not had many opportunities to make friends, but they were alarmed to find out that upon returning home from the meeting she told them she \"would be transitioning�despite never having had any thoughts about transgenderism before the meeting.\"  Their daughter has since desisted in her desire to transition, but endured a \"months-long emotional decline of gender and sexuality confusion that required counseling and included suicidal thoughts,\" according to the lawsuit. BIDEN OFFERS $500K GRANT FOR ENGLISH TEACHERS IN PAKISTAN THAT FOCUS ON TRANSGENDER YOUTH The Jurich family is suing because their daughter was subject to much of the same treatment as the Lee\'s daughter, where students were told by WMS art teacher and staff sponsor of the school-sponsored GSA club, Jenna Riep, \"that if they did not like their bodies, they were most likely not the gender they were �assigned� at birth.\" In addition, Riep \"encouraged secrecy, confidentiality, and suspicion about whether her parents could be trusted with these discussions\" and invited the Jurich\'s daughter to attend a meeting with SPLASH, the organization that Chambers was associated with. PENTAGON DOCTOR CLAIMS PRESCRIBING TRANSGENDER DRUGS TO MINORS CAN CAUSE PSYCHOTIC ILLNESS TO �MELT AWAY\' Following the meeting, their daughter \"began to have her first suicidal thoughts\" and started leaving notes for her parents about transgenderism and stated she was \"aromantic\" and \"asexual.\" In the fall of 2021, she started to question her gender identity.  \"After her experiences at the GSA club her relations with her friends deteriorated, and she was not comfortable with the idea of potentially taking classes with Riep,\" the lawsuit reads. Their daughter\'s emotional state \"underwent a significant decline\" to the point to where she asked to be homeschooled. She eventually attempted suicide by drinking an ounce of bleach and has since \"verbalized that her disturbed emotional state began when she attended GSA at WMS.\" In the same district, Fox News Digital previously reported that the assistant principal of Laurel Elementary School, Amanda Pawelski, asked other administrators how she should address a student whose parents instructed school staff to not use the student�s preferred gender pronouns, according to emails posted on Twitter by the senior fellow with Independent Women\'s Forum Nicole Solas.  \"I feel very strongly about the student but have heard that we legally have to follow the parents� direction due to the age of the child (elementary school),\" Pawelski wrote in the email. \"I�ve also heard that this is different in secondary schools due to legal determination ages.\" The district\'s LGBTQIA+ Coordinator Shayna Seitchik explained that the \"school should use the student�s affirming name and pronouns at school and use their legal name and corresponding pronouns when talking with the family until they are supportive of the student�s new name and pronouns.\" Fox News Digital reached out for comment from Poudre School District. Chief Information Officer Madeline Noblett stated, \"Poudre School District values all students and their right to be supported and welcomed in our buildings. PSD guidelines adopted in January 2023 align with state and federal laws and offer guidance for supporting students in research-backed ways that aim to prevent the discrimination and harassment of transgender and gender non-conforming children.\" Noblett added, \"PSD is in the process of evaluating the lawsuit. That said, we believe the district�s practices around supporting all students, including those who holdthe LGBTQIA+ identity, align with current state and federal law. These guidelines are publicly available on ourwebsite. By law, students have the right to be free from discrimination and have access to a safe and inclusivelearning environment�.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for his Senate seat next year claims he raised more than $2 million in the first 36 hours since launching his campaign. Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, said on Thursday night that his new Senate campaign set a new record for the 2024 election season � kicking off what is likely to be a pricey race. \"I�ve been a part of some incredible teams in my life, but y�all have helped me raise over $2 million in just 36 hours since I announced my campaign to represent all Texans,\" Allred wrote on Twitter. \"Together, we set a record for this cycle raising the most in the first day of a Senate campaign.\" Cruz is running for his third term to represent the Lone Star State in the Senate. CRUZ TELLS FOX NEWS HIS 2024 RE-ELECTION WILL BE A �FIREFIGHT�  Cruz\'s 2018 re-election bid was among the most closely-watched and expensive races in the country at the time. Democrat rival Beto O�Rourke had raised more than double the cash Cruz had, bringing in more than $80 million compared to the conservative Republican�s roughly $39 million. Cruz eked out a narrow victory of just over 2%. Allred is the first major challenger Cruz has for an election that is about a year and a half away. Before being elected to the House of Representatives in 2018, Allred was a professional football player who spent four seasons with the Tennessee Titans between 2007 and 2010.

Then January 6 happened,\" Allred said before cutting to clips of the mob storming the Capitol that day. WHO CAN BEAT MANCHIN IN WEST VIRGINIA?

But that�s Ted for you � all hat, no cattle.\"  He also accused Cruz of caring only for himself, adding, \"We don�t have to be embarrassed by our senator. We can get a new one.\"  While his $2 million haul is significant, Allred will need to keep the aggressive pace up. Cruz began the cycle with $3.3 million in cash on-hand, while bringing in an additional $1.2 million in the first quarter of this year. Representatives for Cruz pointed Fox News Digital to the latest episode of the senator\'s podcast in which he addressed his rival\'s statement directly. \"They\'re going to flood the state with cash trying to turn Texas blue,\" Cruz said. \"He\'s raised over $2 million in a day and a half.

Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., said in a statement introducing her bill that AI has become a factor in the upcoming campaign and needs to be regulated so people can understand what they hear and see on television. \"The upcoming 2024 election cycle will be the first time in U.S. history where AI generated content will be used in political ads by campaigns, parties, and Super PACs,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, our current laws have not kept pace with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies.\" AI REQUIRES �NEW GENERATION� OF ARMS CONTROL DEAL TO GOVERN FUTURE WARFIGHTING, SAYS MARINE VETERAN LAWMAKER  \"If AI-generated content can manipulate and deceive people on a large scale, it can have devastating consequences for our national security and election security,\" she added. An aide to Clarke acknowledged that the bill was prompted by the release of the Republican National Committee\'s AI-generated ad called \"Beat Biden,\" which depicted a dystopian near-future in which President Biden wins re-election in 2024. The ad shows AI-produced images and videos of Taiwan being overrun by Chinese forces, economic collapse in the U.S., a surge in illegal immigrants at the southern border and the shuttering of the entire city of San Francisco due to rampant crime. The aide said the fact that the ad came from the GOP side is irrelevant, and shows that AI is now entering the political world and will soon be used by both major parties. \"It showed us the top dogs are ready,\" he told Fox News Digital. After the GOP ad was released, the Democratic National Committee replied by calling it \"remarkably bad\" and saying that Republicans had to \"make up\" images about a future Biden presidency because they \"can�t argue with President Biden�s results.\" REGULATE AI? GOP MUCH MORE SKEPTICAL THAN DEMS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO IT RIGHT: POLL  Clarke�s legislation would amend the law governing the Federal Election Commission to require TV and online ads to disclose when generative AI is used to create video or images, and warns that AI-generated ads have the potential for \"spreading misinformation and disinformation at scale and with unprecedented speed.\" Her bill would require the FEC to set out regulations that explain when an AI-generated image or video would need to be flagged. The House aide explained that the intent is to give the FEC flexibility on setting the rules, which might only focus on informing viewers when AI was involved in producing major or prominent elements of an ad, and allow exemptions for minor or less prominent AI features. The bill says any covered election communication that includes AI-generated video or images must also include \"a statement that the communication contains such an image or footage,\" and that statement must be presented in a \"clear and conspicuous manner.\" Under the bill, failure to make a required disclosure of the use of AI would carry the same penalty as the failure to disclose who paid for a campaign ad. Clarke is proposing that these changes take effect on January 1, 2024. CHINA FUMES AS BIDEN PLOTS TO STARVE IT OF AI INVESTMENT: �SCI-TECH BULLYING�   Clarke\'s bill is one of several proposals by Congress to start getting a handle on AI and how to regulate it. Leaders in both the House and Senate are calling in experts to discuss the implications of this fast-evolving and widely dispersed technology, and several Biden administration agencies are beginning to tackle ways to regulate AI using their existing regulatory authorities.','Peter Kasperowicz\r'),('Did Apple just help your kids get access to your credit cards?','2023-05-04T13:41:23-04:00','Not Found!','Apple recently sent out an alert via iOS to the primary account holders of Apple Family Purchase Sharing.I have an Apple One plan that I share with my family and received a concerning alert that says, \"Family Purchase Sharing Update\" with a red notification symbol.

Never. I never did,\" Fauci told New York Times Magazine last month.\"I gave a public health recommendation that echoed theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention�s (CDC) recommendation, and people made a decision based on that. But I never criticized the people who had to make the decisions one way or the other.\" \"We wanted to be in school. I�ve said that over and over again today,\" Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), one of the nation�s most powerful teachers unions, said during her congressional testimony about the school lockdowns last week. But history shows that both Fauci and Weingarten vehemently pushed for COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions that led to prolonged school closures across the country.  LOCKDOWNS, MANDATES AND SCANDALS: HOW GAVIN NEWSOM�S COVID-19 RESPONSE BROUGHT CALIFORNIA TO ITS KNEES At the start of the pandemic, Fauci, then-director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), expressed outright support for a federal lockdown to contain the virus. \"Whatever it takes,\" he told CNN on March 15, 2020. Just one week earlier, Fauci said there was \"no reason to be walking around with a mask,\" and that wearing one could even make people sicker, because it causes them to touch their face more frequently. He and the CDC reversed course within weeks and started pushing universal mask mandates for everyone age 2 and older. A study released this January found thatthat widespread masking may have done little to nothing to curb the transmission of COVID-19, and myriad questions still remain about the negative impact that prolonged masking has had on children�s speech and social development. Still, Fauci was featured in a PBS documentary this March saying he regretted not supporting mask mandates and quarantines sooner. \"Maybe I should have done that,\" he said. \"Yeah, I was wrong.\"  DEMS, UNION LEADERS RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHOOL LOCKDOWNS FACE FEW REPURCUSSIONS, DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT KIDS HARMED Masks weren�t the only reversal by the country�s public health experts. In March 2020, Fauci�s NIH published a study saying COVID-19 is \"stable for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces.\" \"Wash hands, avoid close contact, use a face covering, clean inanimate objects,\" Fauci said in August 2020. The CDC later determined the risk of surface transmission of COVID-19 was \"low,\" and Fauci admitted that wiping down groceries was unnecessary. While some schools started reopening as early as August 2020, like in Florida, many local playgrounds remained closed for over a year due to the inanimate object theory. It wasn�t until April 2021 that the CDC said sunlight and weather factors could destroy the virus on outdoor surfaces.  RANDI WEINGARTEN SAYS �BIDEN TRANSITION TEAM� WAS FIRST TO SOLICIT UNION�S ADVICE ON SCHOOLS REOPENING In the summer of 2020, Fauci and the CDC insisted children needed to remain six feet apart in order to prevent the virus� spread, making in-person learning near impossible. \"The minimal thing that you should do is the kind of things that we\'ve been talking about constantly: wearing a mask, maintaining six feet of distance, avoiding crowds,\" Fauci said at the time. The 6-feet standard became one of the largesthurdles schools faced as they struggled to reopen to in-person learningin accordance with the CDC�s guidelines in the spring of 2021. On March 10, 2021, a study in Clinical Infectious Diseases found that there was no significant difference in coronavirus spreading in schools where there were six feet of distancing versus three feet of distancing. Fauci said he supported the study, and days later, the CDC�s guidance was reduced to three feet. In August 2021, Fauci endorsed vaccine mandates for school children, teachers and school staff, in addition to the mask mandates. During a White House press briefing, hestood alongside CDC Director Dr.Rochelle Walensky as she slammed schools in states like Florida for reopening without implementing mask and vaccine mandates for staff and students. Fauci told CNN�s Jake Tapper at the time: \"I have been of this opinion, and I remain of that opinion, that I do believe at the local level, Jake, there should be more mandates.\" Despite Fauci\'s support for mandates, there is still no definitive evidence that current COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission of the virus. Further, the World Health Organization (WHO) determined in March that healthy children between 6 months and 17 years old don�t need the vaccine at all. While the science surrounding COVID-19 remains ever-changing, Fauci routinely demonized those who questioned his assumptions and created an environment where conflicting ideals were dismissed as conspiracies. \"It�s very dangerous,\" Fauci told MSNBC in June 2021. \"A lot of what you�re seeing as attacks on me quite frankly are attacks on science, because all of the things that I have spoken about consistently from the very beginning, have been fundamentally based on science.\"  \"Misinformation and disinformation is really hurting so many things, including people\'s trust in science,\" he complained in December. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat whose restrictive COVID-19 policies were routinely cheered by Fauci, went so far as to sign a law punishing doctors who espoused alleged \"misinformation or disinformation\" related to COVID-19 that was not in line with the mainstream. A federal judge blocked the law in January following a pair of lawsuits challenging it on free speech grounds.  Fauci worked closely with teachers unions in 2021 in an attempt to fulfill President Biden�s promise to reopen \"most\" schools in his first 100 days in office. Fauci and Weingarten argued at the time that billions in funding through the America Rescue Plan would give the teachers the resources they need to get school open safely. $15M IN AMERICAN RESUCE PLAN FUNDS WENT TO �ANTI-RACISM,� �SOCIAL ACTIVISM� PROGRAMS FOR KIDS Fauci said during a teachers union event in January 2021 that he had a \"personal interest\" in keeping teachers safe because his daughter was teaching 3rd-grade science at the time. \"We need the CDC guidance,\" Weingarten said at the event. \"We need these rapid tests, we need to make sure we have the accommodations and the vaccine. I hear that a lot.\" But even after the American Rescue Plan passed in March, without any Republican support, Weingarten demanded billions more in order in order for teachers to return to the classroom safely. $825K IN AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDS WENT TO �ORAL HISTORIANS� RESEARCHING ANTI-RACISM, �LATINX� HISTORIES Weingarten�s pandemic response came to the forefront last week after she appeared beforethe Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic to address her union�s role in influencing public policy on school lockdowns. \"Republicans on the House Covid subcommittee want you to think I wanted to keep schools closed. Here�s what I actually said� over &amp; over again,\"Weingarten tweeted after the hearing.  Fox News Digital previously reported that the AFT and theNational Education Association (NEA) were discovered to have corresponded with the CDC in 2021 to make last-minute changes to school reopening guidance, which included a phased reopening approach for K-12 schools based on coronavirus cases in the area. The New York Post further reported last week that the AFT was even more deeply involved than previously understood, with Weingarten holding two phone calls with CDC Director Rochelle Walensky in the week prior to the guidance�s release.  Communications previously obtained by theNew York Postthrough a Freedom of Information Act requestby conservative groupAmericans for Public Trustshowed numerous emails between top CDC officials and the AFT just days before the Biden administration released the school reopening guidelines in February 2021.The lobbying efforts were a reported success, as the Post found at least two instances when\"suggestions\"were used nearly word-for-word within the CDC�s guidelines. The CDC had been prepared to allow in-school instruction regardless of transmission rates, but at the suggestion of the union, the guidelines were adjusted to include a provision that said, \"In the event of high community-transmission results from a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, a new update of these guidelines may be necessary.\" The union further requested that teachers be granted remote work access for those \"who have documented high-risk conditions or who are at increased risk.\" Similar provisions were included for \"staff who have a household member\" that is considered high risk to the virus. Emails reviewed by Fox News Digital showed that the AFT and the NEA also received a copy of the guidance before the CDC released it to the public. Responding to the backlash over the correspondence, Weingarten suggested it was routine procedure. \"This is normal rulemaking, frankly,\" she told C-SPAN in May 2021. \"This is what every administration used to do. The problem with the last administration is that they didn\'t do it.\" BIDEN ADMIN KEEPS GIVING TEACHERS UNIONS POLITICAL VICTORIES In the video Weingarten tweeted last week in an attempt to prove she supported reopening schools, Weingarten repeatedly says in a number of news clips, \"Wewant schools to reopen.\" What she left out of the video is that her union was demanding a wide range of mitigation requirements at the time, like6-foot physical distancing, contact tracing, retrofitted ventilation systems, and that schools only reopen in places where the government had the authority to \"trigger\" school closures in the event of an uptick in COVID-19 cases. \"There�s no way that you�re going to have full-time schools for all the kids and all the teachers the way we used to have it,\" Weingarten said in July 2020. At the time, Weingarten slammed the Trump administration�s guidelines to reopen schools by fall 2020 as \"reckless,\" \"callous\" and \"cruel.\" She later called on Congress for more federal funding for schools and threatened a strike if they reopened without implementing her union\'s demands.  While many school districts across the country, like in Florida, reopened for the Fall of 2020, Weingarten was advocating for improving remote learning. \"We have an obligation to make remote better, because until we can really decrease community spread throughout the United States, distance learning and distance working is going to be a fact of life,\" she said in August 2020. In July 2021, Weingarten said \"millions\" would die from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis� handling of the pandemic, but she later walked back her claim. RANDI WEINGARTEN SCREAMS ABOUT STUDENT DEBT OUTSIDE SCOTUS: �THAT IS NOT FAIR!� Weingarten signaled the potential for future school lockdowns as recently as January 2022, tweeting, \"There are very real logistical decisions schools are making. We know kids do better in person, but the spike is real. We need adequate staff &amp; the safety measures in place including testing, masking ventilation. There is a lot of stress.\" Weingarten�s tweet came on the heels of her announcement on CNN that she \"personally\" supported mandating the vaccine for school children five and older.  Weingarten testified last week that President Biden\'s transition team was the first to contact her union for guidance on school closures during the pandemic, not the CDC. \"Did the AFT first engage the CDC or did the CDC reach out to you?\" Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, chairman of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, asked the union leader. \"So what essentially happened, sir, was that we were talking to the Biden transition team before he was sworn into office,\" Weingarten responded. \"Did they reach out to you or the CDC?\" Wenstrup asked. \"The Biden transition team reached out to us,\" Weingarten reiterated. AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDS WENT TO LGBTQ CENTER THAT HOSTED �DRAG STORY HOUR� FOR KIDS AT PUBLIC LIBRARY School closures in the U.S. have had a devastating impact on children�s mental health, development and future earnings potential. According to data released last year by the National Center for Education Statistics, 70% of U.S. public schools have reported an increase in students seeking mental health services since the start of the pandemic. A study published by the conservative think tank Just Facts reported that the mental stressors brought about by school closures will destroy seven times more years of life than lockdowns saved. A study by the American Enterprise Institute also found that nearly 1.3 million students have left public schools since the pandemic began, and schools that stayed remote longer saw even more students leave. The World Bank reported that the school closures will cost this generation of students $21 trillion in earnings over their lifetimes, which is far more than the $17 trillion estimated in 2021. A working paper first released in October 2020, which examined over 10,000 school districts across the country and their reopening plans, found that partisan politics and teachers union strength in a particular area had far more influence on schools reopening than science or local health guidance. Despite the numerous studies saying school closures had catastrophic effects on one of the nation�s most vulnerable populations, the leaders responsible for the lockdowns have not been recalled or fired in the more than three years since the pandemic struck. Weingarten was reelected to serve an eighth term last year at AFT�s convention in Boston.  Fauci now does the media rounds defending his pandemic response after stepping down as Biden\'s chief medical advisor in December. Fauci told Fox News in August that he still doesn�t believe the lockdowns went too far. \"Well, I don\'t think it\'s forever irreparably damaged anyone,\" he said, adding, \"People selectively � pull things out about me.\"','Jessica Chasmar\r'),('Ferrari\'s $400K SUV is sold out until 2026','2023-05-05T08:08:43-04:00','Not Found!','If you stop by your friendly local Ferrari dealer today and order a car, it will be two years before you get it.

The drug, called Arexvy, is approved for use by people 60 years and older to prevent RSV, which is a lower respiratory tract disease. \"Older adults, in particular those with underlying health conditions, such as heart or lung disease or weakened immune systems, are at high risk for severe disease caused by RSV,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, PhD, director of the FDA�s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, in the FDA\'s announcement. RSV SURGE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT REPEAT CASES: CAN YOU OR CHILD GET IT AGAIN? \"Today�s approval of the first RSV vaccine is an important public health achievement to prevent a disease which can be life-threatening and reflects the FDA�s continued commitment to facilitating the development of safe and effective vaccines for use in the United States,\" he continued.  A common respiratory virus that is highly contagious, RSV generally causes mild, cold-like symptoms that usually last a week or two, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). LOWER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS WHEN YOUNG COULD BE LINKED TO EARLIER ADULT DEATHS: STUDY For people in some high-risk groups, including older adults and babies, the virus can cause more serious conditions. In older adults, RSV infections can lead to lung infection or pneumonia, and also could cause complications in those who have asthma, heart disease, weak immune systems or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), per the CDC.  Around 60,000-160,000 older adults are hospitalized in the U.S. with RSV each year � and between 6,000-1,000 die from the virus, the CDC states. Study showed �critical benefits� of vaccine The FDA conducted an \"an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study\" to ensure Arexvy�s safety and effectiveness of a single dose for people 60 years and older, according to the announcement. Of the 25,000 study participants, half received the vaccine and half received a placebo. \"The vaccine significantly reduced the risk of developing RSV-associated LRTD (lower respiratory tract infection) by 82.6% and reduced the risk of developing severe RSV-associated LRTD by 94.1%,\" the FDA said. \"To put that in perspective, there were seven RSV cases in the vaccine group and 40 cases in the placebo group,\" Dr. Shana Johnson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician in Scottsdale, Arizona, told Fox News Digital. \"Reducing severe disease, such as hospitalizations and death, are the critical benefits.\"  The most common side effects reported in the study were injection site pain, muscle pain, fatigue, joint pain/stiffness and headache. The FDA also ran two smaller studies that included about 2,500 people 60 years of age and older. In one of those studies, in which participants received both Arexvy and an influenza vaccine, two people developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) � a rare type of inflammation that affects the brain and spinal cord � within seven and 22 days of inoculation. Around 60,000-160,000 older adults are hospitalized in the U.S. with RSV each year.

GOP Reps. Ken Buck of Colorado and Andy Biggs of Arizona are introducing a new resolution to expressing the House of Representatives� support of local law enforcement and \"condemning efforts to defund or dismantle local law enforcement agencies.\" Buck told Fox News Digital that National Police Week is an opportunity to show support for our men and women in blue after they have been \"mercilessly attacked\" following the 2020 George Floyd riots. SHERROD BROWN WILL VOTE TO OVERTURN DC CRIME BILL DESPITE PAST COMMENTS DEFENDING �DEFUND THE POLICE�  \"Ever since the George Floyd riots of 2020, our brave men and women in blue have been mercilessly attacked for solely doing their jobs,\" Buck said. \"Shamefully, leftist activists and progressive politicians have continued to call for the defunding and dismantling of local police departments across the country,\" the Colorado Republican continued. \"We\'re not going to let that happen.\" \"National Police Week is an opportunity to show our support to local law enforcement for upholding the rule of law and selflessly protecting our communities,\" he added. Biggs told Fox News Digital that Americans \"must �back the blue� now more than ever.\" \"Crime is surging across our cities in virtually every major statistic,\" Biggs said. \"These heroes are the only ones putting themselves in harm�s way to uphold our rule of law and ensure public safety.� \"These courageous men and women volunteer to keep our communities safer every day. At the very least, they deserve our gratitude and respect,\" the Arizona Republican continued. \"I am grateful to introduce this much-needed resolution along with my good friend Congressman Buck.\"  In addition to the House resolution putting the lower chamber�s support behind local law enforcement and condemning the defund the police movement, the resolution slams \"leftist activists and progressive politicians\" who \"called for the defunding and dismantling of local police departments across the country and actively encouraged resentment toward local law enforcement.\" The \"defund the police\" movement gained steam in the wake of the Floyd riots in 2020, with progressive politicians, including \"Squad\" Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Some localities actually went through with defunding and depowering the police amid the leftist political push, and the reverberations are still sounding strong today. Downtown Austin, Texas has become a hotspot for illegal street racing and other crimes as they face a law enforcement staffing crisis after slashing the police funding by $100 million. Austin has been bleeding cops, leading to Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson inviting the departing patrolmen to join his city\'s police force. The nation�s capital, Washington, D.C., has become the poster child of rampant crime after the city council overturned Mayor Muriel Bowser�s veto of a controversial crime bill that could die after congressional action.  Several high-profile examples of crime in the nation\'s capital have underscored the crisis. A Senate staffer was stabbed in the head while walking in the city, a Virginia college student going to a concert was murdered in her hotel room, and a pair of 12-year-olds were charged in two separate crime sprees. The growing juvenile crime problem in D.C. saw an Uber driver killed in 2021 when he was flung from his car after it was jacked by two 15-year-old girls and four teenagers arrested last month following a five-day crime spree of 13 violent robberies.  The April arrests came amid a skyrocketing rate of carjackings in the nation\'s capital, which has already seen 169 carjacking incidents year-to-date, according to D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) statistics. Of those, 73% have involved guns. Twenty-one people have been arrested over carjacking incidents, with 57% of such arrests involving juveniles, according to MPD.

CHINA, RUSSIA, NORTH KOREA, IRAN ARE INVESTING IN WAYS TO NUKE US. THE TIME IS NOW FOR MISSILE DEFENSE In recent months, more women have defied the hijab law, which is enforced by Iran�s so-called morality police. Some of these protests have gone viral, such as the case of a group of teen girls who posted a TikTok video of themselves dancing without hijab to a Selena Gomez song. The girls became the target of a police investigation. Authorities placed competitive climber Elnaz Rekabi under house arrest after she competed without a hijab during the International Federation of Sport Climbing Asia Championship in South Korea in late 2022.  Iran�s newly appointed chief of police announced in April that his officers will use surveillance cameras and artificial intelligence to detect women who defy the hijab law, France 24 reported. The new technology will also allow authorities to pressure business owners and offices to enforce hijab laws or risk being shut down. The head of an Iranian government agency that enforces morality laws said in an interview last year that the facial technology would allow officers to \"identify inappropriate and unusual movements,\" such as not adhering to the hijab laws, Wired magazine reported. AI COULD BE �NAIL IN THE COFFIN� FOR THE INTERNET, WARNS ASTROPHYSICIST Some question the government�s ability to implement such measures, but Frederike Kaltheuner, director of Human Rights Watch�s technology division, told Fox News Digital that \"every government is heavily invested in AI technology,\" including \"the use of AI for policing, security, technology at the border\" and other uses. \"This is a trend that we\'ve observed globally for many, many years, so Iran is by no means an exception,\" Kaltheuner said, noting the group has not focused specifically on Iran due to difficulty accessing the country but that AI is \"supercharging surveillance\" around the world.  \"It�s doing that in a number of ways,\" she said. \"First of all, the moment you add face recognition, object recognition, emotion detection, etc., at the moment you add this to CCTV cameras, you�re basically changing what it means to be in public spaces.\" \"You can no longer be anonymous in public, you become identifiable, and that�s a game changer for things like protests or even just walking around the street, and there�s a dual threat with that,\" she continued. \"On the one hand, if the technology works well, there�s � an invasion of privacy and anonymity, but there�s also a problem if the technology doesn�t work, if it misidentifies people.\" POLICE USING AI COULD LEAD TO �PREDICTIVE\' CRIME PREVENTION �SLIPPERY SLOPE,� EXPERTS ARGUE  Kaltheuner also raised concerns about increased profiling in the initial use of AI technology since these systems rely heavily on pattern recognition, especially if it needs to identify specific behaviors and lacks the ability to read context. Mahsa Alimardani, a senior researcher at Article 19 and a doctoral candidate at the University of Oxford, told Vice�s \"Cyber Podcast\" that while it�s hard to know what Iran has developed in terms of this technology, the potential is frightening based on what the country can already do with limited use.  \"I have documented myself several cases of women who have been identified breaking hijab laws in their cars and have been, you know, later ticketed and asked to come in,\" Alimardani said. \"Some have been asked to come into the same morality police station that Mahsa Amini was detained in before her murder.\" \"The experience I�ve heard from women so far has been more like a speeding ticket,\" she said, saying that often the women have the hijab but are not wearing it in the proper manner.   Alimardani also described how the regime has invested heavily in AI technologies in hopes of using it to better police digital platforms and catch citizens attempting to circumvent firewalls that prevent access to blocked foreign platforms. \"It has been making it quite difficult for users to mobilize, communicate and document,\" Alimardani said. \"Every kind of piece of content we have been seeing since September coming out of Iran, there�s a story in terms of what lengths that user had to go to achieve connectivity, to get that content on Twitter or on Telegram or on Instagram.\"','Peter Aitken\r'),('IRS touts Biden\'s legislation for \'Small Business Week\' despite concerns law will hurt small businesses','2023-05-04T22:18:02-04:00','Not Found!','The IRS used National Small Business Week to tout President Biden\'s Inflation Reduction Act, which critics argue will allow the IRS to target small businesses for more tax money. National Small Business Week runs from April 30 through May 6. To mark the occasion, the IRS sent out a news release giving \"advice\" on how small business taxpayers can take advantage of new and existing tax benefits. \"The IRS is joining the Small Business Administration and others in both the public and private sector to celebrate the hard work, ingenuity and dedication of America\'s small businesses and their contributions to the economy,\" the release said. \"With next year�s filing deadline nearly a year away, entrepreneurs still have time to identify possible tax benefits, take action to qualify for them and then claim them when they file in 2024. They also have time to plan for reporting changes and even claim overlooked tax benefits from the recent past.\" The IRS noted potential benefits for businesses that continued paying their employees during the COVID pandemic and that help pay their employees\' student loan obligations, among others. However, the first benefits listed were ways for small businesses to \"cut energy costs\" and \"expand clean energy credits\" due to the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive, Democrat-backed spending package that Biden signed into law last year.  IRS UNVEILS SPENDING PLAN FOR $80B FUNDING BOOST \"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted last summer, includes provisions that can save small business owners money on energy costs,\" the release said. \"Small businesses can receive a tax credit covering 30% of the cost of switching over to low-cost solar power, lowering operating costs and protecting against volatile energy prices. \"Small business building owners can receive a tax credit up to $5 per square foot to support energy efficiency improvements that deliver lower utility bills. Through the Clean Commercial Vehicle Credit, small businesses that use vehicles such as trucks and vans can benefit from tax credits up to 30% of purchase costs for clean commercial vehicles, like electric and fuel cell models that meet applicable requirements. \"There is no limit on the number of Clean Commercial Vehicle credits a business can claim. These credits are nonrefundable, so businesses can\'t get back more on the credit than they owe in taxes.\" The news release came two weeks after Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, wrote a letter to IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel accusing his agency of launching a \"witch hunt\" against small businesses over its plan outlining how it will spend money from Biden\'s Inflation Reduction Act. \"Now is simply not the time to place unnecessary burdens on our small businesses as they continue to grapple with recent economic challenges,\" Ernst wrote. \"Instead of commencing on a witch hunt on small businesses by enhancing audit rates without justification, we should focus on tax solutions that promote small business growth and economic competitiveness.\" The Inflation Reduction Act granted $80 billion to the IRS to hire thousands of new employees over the next decade. The IRS wrote in its recently published \"strategic operating plan\" that it will use the funds in part to \"increase enforcement activities in other key areas where audit coverage has declined while complying with Treasury\'s directive not to increase audit rates relative to historical levels for small businesses and households earning $400,000 per year or less.\" Ernst specifically cited that provision, which suggests businesses making more than $400,000 per year could be subject to the IRS\'s increased \"enforcement activities,\" arguing such a threshold is lower than any other industry standard for a \"large business.\"  ERNST ACCUSES IRS OF \'WITCH HUNT\' AGAINST SMALL BUSINESSES WITH AUDIT PROPOSAL The senator demanded that Werfel provide more clarity on how the IRS proposal would be implemented, such as whether the $400,000 figure references net income or the business�s revenue. \"It is not clear by which precedent the IRS determined that a large business is any entity earning more than $400,000 in revenues. Under this approach, enhanced tax enforcement efforts would sweepingly apply to small businesses across the country,\" Ernst wrote. \"It is abundantly clear that small businesses will bear the brunt of these enforcement efforts; not solely large corporations and the wealthiest taxpayers.\" The senator noted that a small business with about five employees would bring in more than $424,000 on average, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Both Werfel and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have repeatedly vowed that funding from the Inflation Reduction Act will not go toward increased audits for middle- and low-income Americans or anyone making less than $400,000 per year. When reached for comment for this story, the IRS directed Fox News Digital to comments made by Werfel in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee last week. \"[Inflation Reduction Act] funding also gives us an important opportunity to improve enforcement efforts to promote fairness while respecting taxpayers\' rights,\" said Werfel. \"The agency will follow Secretary Yellen\'s directive not to raise audit rates above historic levels for small businesses and households making less than $400,000. \"I want to be crystal clear: We are not increasing audit rates for hardworking taxpayers making under $400,000. That is my pledge. There is no new surge of audits coming for workers, retirees and others.\"  IRS ISSUES 12 MILLION TAX REFUNDS AFTER CORRECTING FOR 2020 UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT BREAK A Government Accountability Office report from last year found that the majority of IRS audits historically are conducted on individuals and businesses below the $400,000 threshold. Werfel later added that the IRS\' \"plan is to focus our enforcement efforts on complex returns of high-wealth filers.\" Despite the IRS chief\'s comments, however, Yellen didn\'t deny in congressional testimony in March that potentially 90% of new IRS audits using Inflation Reduction Act resources would come from lower- and middle-income individuals making less than $400,000 annually. Indeed, Yellen was asked by Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., to clarify whether her directive meant the total number of audits annually of families earning less than $400,000 wouldn\'t increase or if shemeantthe proportion of new audits targeting those families wouldn\'t exceed historical rates. \"I\'m talking about the proportion of those small businesses and families,\" Yellen responded. \"OK, so the proportion. I mean, just for the record, the proportion is 90%,\" said Smith, referencing the GAO report. \"So, 90% of the new audits will be, you know, according to the data, that we can expect up to 90% of new audits to be on those making less than $400,000.\"  YELLEN DOESN\'T DENY THAT 90% OF NEW IRS AUDITS WOULD AFFECT THOSE MAKING UNDER $400K Yellen didn\'t reject Smith\'s conclusion but reiterated that the purpose is to increase the audit rates on high-income earners. However, Smith pointed to data that suggests it will be \"broader than that.\" Both the GAO and Syracuse University\'s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse have found in repeated analyses that low-income taxpayers are audited at a much higher rate than high-income earners. Experts say it\'s difficult to calculate an average cost of an IRS audit for the ordinary American, since each audit is unique to a particular circumstance. Some organizations put the average at thousands for a mail audit and tens of thousands for a more intrusive IRS field audit. That doesn\'t include additional penalties or potentially thousands of dollars needed to pay for lawyers or accountants to help with the auditing process, which can be complex and require going through confusing paperwork.  Another issue that taxpayers can face when confronted with audits is the legal process should they challenge the IRS. Unlike normal courtrooms, where defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, in tax court the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to prove the IRS wrong.','Aaron Kliegman\r'),('I�m a U.S. senator and I want to know why the Air Force base in my state hosted a drag show for minors','2023-05-05T10:00:27-04:00','Not Found!','Social \"equity\" warriors believe America is infected with systemic racism and social inequity and are working relentlessly to impose their radical, woke agenda on every aspect of society, including the military. Their use of the Biden administration and Democrats in Congress to enact their agenda through legislative and regulatory action is having dire consequences that are on full display for the entire country to see. The administration�s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan cost the lives of 13 of our servicemen and women. The Chinese spy balloon that lingered over Montana�s nuclear missile sites before traversing the rest of the country collected intelligence from some of our most sensitive sites. In addition, the Army was 25% short of its recruiting goal last year and projections indicate this year will be even worse for all branches. Public confidence in our armed forces is trending downward, and sexual assault within the ranks is on the rise. SAILOR DISCHARGED OVER VACCINE MANDATE REACTS TO NAVY USING DRAG QUEEN FOR RECRUITMENT It is particularly disturbing for me to see evidence of the left�s agenda at work at Montana�s own Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls. The 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom controls 150 ICBMs, the most powerful nuclear weapons known to mankind. In June 2021 the base hosted � and promoted on official media � a \"Drag Story Time\" for children followed by a drag show.  Alarmingly, this was not an isolated event�several other similar events happened on our military bases across the country, including Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia and Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.  Reaction from Pentagon leadership to these events is alarming. When asked about the drag show at Malmstrom during a congressional hearing in March, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was unaware of such events occurring and said they \"should not be happening.\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said drag shows are not something that the Department of Defense funds. Yet in a formal response to my pointed questions, the Pentagon said, \"Event spaces on the installation are made available to military-affiliated individuals and installation-recognized private organizations to host events with a variety of themes.\"  The response also claimed that \"no taxpayer funds were spent to host or facilitate the event.\" It�s very difficult to reconcile the claim that any event held on a U.S. military installation and shared on the base�s official social media channels did not use any taxpayer resources. It also raises the question of just who is in charge. Sadly, not even our military academies are immune to the left�s influence as they are encouraging students to study the tenets of critical race theory. The Air Force Academy is policing the everyday language of cadets, going as far as to discourage the use of \"offensive\" terms like \"mom\" and \"dad.\" This could partially explain why applications for service academy appointments from my office have decreased every year since President Joe Biden took office.  In addition, at a department-sanctioned \"Extremism Stand Down Day,\" the Navy distributed training materials to sailors that explicitly state, \"conservative,\" \"religious\" views of \"marriage, abortion, and LGBTQ rights\" are \"not considered mainstream.\"  When asked about the drag show at Malmstrom during a congressional hearing in March, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was unaware of such events occurring and said they \"should not be happening.\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said drag shows are not something that the Department of Defense funds.  These and other misguided actions suggest Pentagon leadership is looking the other way in order to appease the left�s agenda. In fact, the Pentagon says Austin is concerned about the public�s perception of the armed forces, but he has done nothing to stop the left�s agenda. It�s past time for Congress to flex its Article 1 power and hold the administration accountable through the power of the purse and when drafting the next National Defense Authorization Act. In addition, I am introducing legislation to prohibit the funding of \"adult cabaret performances\" on military bases. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Our country�s original motto, \"E Pluribus Unum\" or \"Out of Many, One,\" reflects the extraordinary strength and power of a diverse American people that�s unified in purpose and core values. But in true irony, radical activists and their allies in the Biden administration seek to stifle viewpoints that run contrary to their own � regardless of the cost. They seem to define diversity as everybody looking very different, but forced to sing from the same woke hymnal. Their actions are actually extremely disrespectful toward Americans who volunteer to serve their country. The government�s top priority is to protect U.S. citizens and provide for our national defense. Nothing is worth putting our national security on the line, especially not ideological pandering that distracts from core military objectives and keeps some of our finest men and women out of our armed services altogether.  Ultimately, the American people will have their say at the ballot box in 2024.  My hope is that they hold the Biden administration and its enablers in Congress responsible. The security of our nation depends on it.

KENTUCKY DERBY: THE HISTORY OF THE RACES AND LONG STANDING TRADITIONS What to do before betting on a horse? Before you begin putting money on any bets at the Kentucky Derby, please consider taking a few steps to ensure that you\'re making a good financial decision and having fun in the process. Start by studying the horse or jockey you bet on before throwing in the money. Read about past race results, backstories, and the odds for who is favored to win a particular race. If you are newer to the world of gambling or horse betting, start by placing bets on the horses that are favorites to win. Although you won\'t receive a huge payout compared to betting on the underdog, it is safer. If you are betting on a total of 12 horse races, you should bet on the favorite for all of them in order to likely win four or five.

In 2015, Richie attended a charity fundraising event for Jewish Care which also welcomed Prince William. During a speech, the musician shared that he had the privilege of meeting William\'s mother, Princess Diana, about 10 years before her death in 1997. \"Many years ago I had the pleasure of meeting Princess Diana and tonight we have Prince William here,\" Richie said in 2015, per E! News. KING CHARLES\' CORONATION CONCERT: KATY PERRY AND LIONEL RICHIE WILL PERFORM  \"I must tell you it is a pleasure to be with all of you but especially this gentleman, because his mother came to me...and she said, \'My favorite song is \'Hello.\'\' So I thought, tonight the dedication is to you, my friend.\" William thanked Richie for his kind words and \"giving your time to entertain us.\" \"I imagine the crowd here will be rowdier that what you\'ll have at Glastonbury,\" William joked. Richie and Diana first crossed paths during his concert in London in 1986. At the time, Richie performed his 1984 hit, \"Hello,\" which he shared was Diana\'s favorite song. The singer and his then-wife, Brenda Harvey, also gifted the princess two leather jackets for her sons: William and Harry. The boys were 4 and 2 at the time.    For Charles\' coronation concert on Sunday, the \"All Night Long\" singer will be joined by fellow \"American Idol\" judge Katy Perry and Andrea Bocelli, Take That, Sir Bryn Terfel, Freya Ridings and Alexis Ffrench. In an interview with E! News at the Breakthrough Prize ceremony last month, Richie shared his own tips for when it comes to navigating royal protocol ahead of his trip across the pond. \"There\'s always something where I go, \'Oh, I didn\'t know that,\'\" he told the outlet. \"Be prepared, just be sure to just say sir and ma\'am�forget everything else. Just remember sir and ma\'am, and you kind of walk your way through.\"  Richie explained that Charles personally requested a specific song for him to perform at the coronation concert. \"And the answer is yes, I will do it,\" he said. \"We will not reveal because it\'s completely enveloped in secrecy. So, all I can tell you is I\'m very happy to be there.\" Richie could not be happier for Charles on his big day. The king immediately ascended the throne in September after his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died at age 96.  \"I\'m very happy for him,\" Richie said. \"He\'s kind of waited in that second position for a very long time. And I think what we\'re gonna get now is the new version of the royal family. I\'m looking forward to see what he\'s going to bring to the table, and I can tell you right now, he\'s gonna change it up a little bit.\" The \"Hello\" singer also spoke with Entertainment Tonight at the event, noting his longtime collaborations with the king. \"We\'ve been friends a long time, I\'ve knownhim a long time, but to be asked is the whole thing,\" Richie said. The singer has worked for many years as the founding Global Ambassador for the Prince�s Trust, a charity Charles began when he was the Prince of Walesdedicated to helping young people \"get into jobs, education and training,\" per its website.  Richie also teased the preparation involved in the show, saying, \"There\'s more secrecy than you\'ve ever imagined in your life.\" \"I know what I\'m going to do but when you ask, \'What is everyone else going to do?\' Nothing. \'Who is everybody else?\' \'Hmmm.\' \'OK, well, what\'s the production going to be like?\' [No response],\"he explained. \"So we won\'t really know until we get there for the rehearsal to find out exactly how big.\" KATY PERRY HOPES TO BRING \'LIGHT AND LOVE\' TO KING CHARLES� CORONATION CONCERT \"And, by the way, I\'m going to use that word \'huge.\' Not just big, [it\'s going to be] off the charts,\" Richie added. Meanwhile, Perry has a special relationship with the king herself.  In 2020, at the Banqueting House in London, Charles announced the \"Firework\" singer as an ambassador of the British Asian Trust�s Children�s Protection Fund for India. The pair first met in India in November 2019, People magazine reported. Perry was in Mumbai as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador at the time. Last week, Perry explained that she hopes to bring \"light and love\" to Charles coronation.  \"It\'s natural because it\'s a foundation that helps in child trafficking which is massive and horrible,\" Perry explained in an interview to Access Hollywood. \"I\'m also an ambassador for UNICEF, so both of those things really are my core values and as a mother, I know first hand what\'s most important � which are these innocent children.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER She continued, \"I\'m going there to represent myself as an ambassador and just to bring the light and the love.

Kennedy Jr, saying it should be the voters, not the politicians or parties that decide the front-runner. Biden has said very little and made scant appearances since last weekend\'s White House Correspondents\' Dinner and has not said much about Williamson or Kennedy. He also launched his reelection campaign by pre-recorded video, as opposed to a rally. In previous remarks, Williamson claimed the Democratic National Committee essentially \"admitted\" they \"rigged\" the primary, in part by moving South Carolina\'s venue ahead of New Hampshire, because \"they know [Biden] did not do well in New Hampshire.\" MARIANNE WILLIAMSON CHALLENGES BIDEN IN 2024 PRIMARY  \"They know that New Hampshirites are very open to independent and more progressive voices,\" she said earlier this week. On \"Hannity,\" Williamson said in a democracy it is \"important that people have a right to see their options.\" \"I think this is an extremely important time in American history, and anyone who feels moved to run for president should have their say � and the voters should hear what they have to say � They should hear their agenda and the voters should decide who they want to be president.\" Williamson however demurred when pressed by host Sean Hannity whether she recognizes Biden\'s \"cognitive decline\" as a vulnerability in both the election and his role as leader of the free world. Williamson said she is not a physician and that it is up to each American to look and listen to Biden and draw their own conclusions about his competency to hold office. \"I wouldn\'t be running if I didn\'t think that I was a better candidate. I think I have the energy, and certainly I have the ideas,\" she said after Hannity pressed again. \"I think every American can decide for themselves.\" 2024 POLLS A WARNING SIGN FOR BIDEN  Williamson quipped she also has the energy needed to take on either former President Donald Trump or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the general election. The governor has not yet announced but is strongly predicted to do so. Hannity went on to press Williamson on her economic platform, saying that he is a capitalist who believes in lower taxes and limited government. Williamson said the capitalist system has \"lost some of its soul\" over the last half century, and invoked the 18th century architect of modern market capitalism, Adam Smith. Williamson noted the famed Scotsman said capitalism cannot exist outside an ethical context, suggesting it has become too unfettered for the wealthiest and most privileged in the United States at present-day. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"So I believe that the American people, our safety, our health and our well-being should come before short-term profits for huge corporate entities,\" she said. Williamson went on to criticize the Trump tax cuts, saying that she wants lower taxes for middle-class Americans but would like to see a 2% wealth tax on those making more than $50 million and an additional 1% blanket tax on billionaires. \"It wouldn\'t affect their day,\" she said. Williamson later elicited a laugh from the studio audience when she responded to Hannity identifying a question about the idea of \"to each based on their need; from each according to their ability\" as having originated from Karl Marx. \"Well, thank God I didn\'t say yes [to agreeing with the mantra] because then you\'d be calling me a Marxist,\" she quipped.','Charles Creitz\r'),('Meet the American who created the Kentucky Derby, Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr., born of pioneers','2023-05-05T03:00:17-04:00','Not Found!','The Kentucky Derby is a global sports spectacle and, in the eyes of many, America�s definitive sporting tradition. The event was forged, almost incredibly, by two of the great epic events in United States history: the triumph of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the tragedy of the Civil War. The bluegrass seeds of the world\'s most famous horse race were planted by a fascinating man with a uniquely American heritage. MEET THE AMERICAN WHO WROTE THE MOON-LANDING SOFTWARE: MARGARET HAMILTON, COMPUTER WHIZ AND MOM His name is Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. He\'s the founder of both the Kentucky Derby, which was has been run every year since 1875, and the Louisville Jockey Club, later known as Churchill Downs.  \"Clark�s impact on the Kentucky Derby and on horse racing in general cannot be overstated,\" Chris Goodlett, senior director of curatorial and education affairs at the Kentucky Derby Museum, told Fox News Digital. \"He was extremely important, to say the least.\" \"Clark�s impact on the Kentucky Derby and on horse racing in general cannot be overstated.\" � Chris Goodlett, Kentucky Derby Museum If the name Meriwether Lewis Clark sounds familiar, it should. The founder of the Kentucky Derby is the grandson of one of the great heroes of American history, famed explorer William Clark. He was named for Clark\'s equally legendary partner, Meriwether Lewis.  The Lewis and Clark Expedition traversed the vast, rugged, unrecorded American interior from St. Louis to the Pacific Ocean and back between 1804 and 1806. The journey made both men national heroes.  \"The direct link to the Kentucky Derby comes through William Clark,\" James J. Holmberg wrote for the Filson Historical Society in Louisville. ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, SEPT. 23, 1806, LEWIS AND CLARK RETURN TO ST. LOUIS AS HEROES AFTER JOURNEY \"His love of horses was passed onto his son, Meriwether Lewis Clark.\" The elder Meriwether Lewis Clark raised dozens of horses and kept detailed records of them. Clark Jr. grew up in a culture shaped by dauntless pioneers and horsemen.  The Kentucky Derby also sprang from the desire of Kentucky�s horse-racing community to recover from the devastation of the Civil War. Clark was at the forefront of an effort that helped unite the nation through love of horses, sports, spectacle � and rowdy, old-fashioned good times. Pioneer\'s namesake Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. was born on Jan. 27, 1846 in Jefferson County, Kentucky, to Meriwether Lewis and Abigail Prather (Churchill) Clark. His family called him Lutie. His father, Clark Sr., was the oldest child of William Clark, the Army officer, explorer and later governor of the Missouri Territory. Grandpa Clark died eight years before Lutie was born.  The bond shared by William Clark and Meriwether Lewis is evident in the most intimate tribute imaginable: Clark named his firstborn son after his partner in exploration. Lewis never had children. KENTUCKY DERBY: THE HISTORY OF THE RACES AND LONG STANDING TRADITIOINS Clark Sr. served as a U.S. Army officer in the Mexican-American War, then as a general in the Confederate army in the Civil War. Clark Jr. was of military age during the conflict but his service, if any, appears unknown. Kentucky played a unique role in America\'s deadliest conflict. It was a slave state, but never seceded from the Union. \"The direct link (from Lewis and Clark explorations) to the Kentucky Derby comes through William Clark.\" � Filson Historical Society in Louisville.  It also drew particular attention from President Abraham Lincoln, who was born in Kentucky in 1809. \"I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game,\" Lincoln wrote in a letter to Sen. O.H. Browning of Illinois in 1861.  The Union did not lose Kentucky. Nor did it gain it. The commonwealth was ravaged by internal conflict amid the wider national bloodshed. Kentucky�s economy was devastated by the war, including its cherished horse-racing industry, which dates back to the arrival of the first pioneers in the late 1700s.  \"Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. himself had no known racing interest until 1872, when a group of horse breeders, concerned with the decline of horse-racing in Louisville, approached him with a plan to save it,\" reports the Filson Historical Society. He built the track on 80 acres leased from his uncles John and Henry Churchill.  He visited Europe, where he was impressed by the spectacle and the quality of the Epsom Races in Britain. He returned with a plan to revive Kentucky\'s horse-racing industry with an equally glamorous spectacle. \"He built the track on 80 acres leased from his uncles John and Henry Churchill, just three miles south of downtown Louisville,\" Churchill Downs reports in its online history.  Clark raised money by selling membership subscriptions to the track, the Louisville Jockey Club.  \"With 320 membership subscriptions sold for $100 each, Clark raised a total of $32,000,\" Churchill Downs notes. \"A group of horse breeders, concerned with the decline of horse-racing in Louisville, approached Clark with a plan to save it.\" \"This profit was used to construct a clubhouse, grandstand, Porter�s Lodge and six stables on site for the opening of the track. Throughout the years, the initial structures still stand, but the racetrack has continued to grow and modernize.\" �Grand success� The first Kentucky Derby was held on May 17, 1875. It was one of three races at the Louisville Jockey Club that day. \"The opening day of the Kentucky Derby, at Louisville, on Monday, was a grand success,\" raved the Interior Journal of Stanford, Kentucky.  The derby apparently debuted with many of the traditions still cherished today, according to historian Goodlett. Among them: racing fans lubricated by Kentucky bourbon fashioned into aromatic mint juleps while dressed in their celebratory finery. CHURCHILL DOWNS SUSPENDS TRAINER SAFFIE JOSEPH JR. INDEFINITELY AFTER SUDDEN DEATH OF HORSES AT TRACK \"The attendance was upward of 12,000,\" the New Orleans Republican reported. \"The grandstand being thronged by a brilliant assemblage of ladies and gentlemen.\" Aristides, a majestic chestnut colt, galloped to victory against a field of 14 other thoroughbreds \"in the fastest time ever made by a three-year-old,\" according to another contemporary account.  Aristides was owned by H. Price McGrath; jockeyed by Oliver Lewis, a 19-year-old African American (both men from Kentucky); and trained by Ansel Williamson, a former slave and legendary American horseman. Williamson was born into slavery in Virginia in 1806. He was sent to work at famed Woodburn Stud in Louisville in 1864 in the midst of the Civil War. NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER: �OUR COUNTRY NEEDS PRAYER NOW AS MUCH AS AT ANY OTHER TIME OF NATIONAL CRISIS� It was there that Williamson heroically saved Asteroid, Kentucky�s most famous thoroughbred of the era, from Quantrill�s Raiders, a notorious band of Confederate horsemen that included among its members Frank and Jesse James. Aristides, the first Kentucky Derby winner, was trained by Ansel Williamson, a former slave and legendary American horseman. Quantrill�s Raiders scoured Kentucky for horses in the desperate final months of the war when they came across Woodburn Stud � seeking its most legendary horse. \"At the stable one of the guerrillas asked for Asteroid by name,\" author William P. Magnum II wrote for The Filson Club Historical Quarterly in 1996.  \"Because it was dark, the shrewd trainer Ansel pulled a switch and substituted an inferior horse. The substitution was a brave act because the guerrillas demanded the horses at gunpoint.\" Williamson had \"saved the best horse in the stable,\" Woodburn Stud owner Robert A. Alexander reportedly said. Black jockeys and trainers such as 1875 champions Lewis and Willamson, many of them former slaves, dominated the early days of the Kentucky Derby, winning 15 of the first 28 races and training six of the first 17 winners, notes the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights. Tragic death Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. never lived to see the Run for the Roses blossom into the stunning spectacle it is today. He died by his own hand, shooting himself in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 22, 1899. He was 53 years old.  There is a haunting precedent to his death. Clark�s namesake, explorer Meriwether Lewis, reportedly killed himself by gunshot, too, also in Tennessee, in 1809. The cause of his death has been disputed. Clark Jr. was reportedly suffering great financial hardship, spurred by massive losses in the stock market crash and the Panic of 1893. The signature twin spires were added to Churchill Downs in 1895.  The Derby itself has suffered lean years after the promise of 1875. \"The track was not in good financial shape, there were short fields and it wasn�t certain what the Derby would become,\" said Goodlett.  The shortest field came in 1892, when only three horses ran in the Kentucky Derby. (In 1905, only three horses ran as well, after two others scratched.) In 1894, Clark surrendered leadership of the event. New management took over, solidified the event and expanded the infrastructure. The signature twin spires were added to Churchill Downs the following year, 1895.

Its first confirmed appearance was at the 47th race in 1921. Twenty of the world�s fastest racehorses typically compete in the Kentucky Derby, with no fear of a dismal field of three. More than 150,000 people pack Churchill Downs each year. Millions more gather around TVs and at parties from coast to coast, many dressed in their Derby finest, as if they�re at Churchill Downs.  The winning horse will earn $1.86 million this year. \"We know what the Kentucky Derby has become � an incredible sporting and cultural event not just in the U.S. but around the world,\" said Goodlett.  \"It wouldn�t have happened if we didn�t have what Clark started.\" But, the historian added, \"the scope of the Kentucky Derby today was never known to him.\" To read more stories in this unique \"Meet the American Who�\" series from Fox News Digital, click here.','Kerry Byrne\r'),('Meg Ryan seen for first time in 6 months as she supports pal Michael J Fox at documentary screening','2023-05-04T21:16:40-04:00','Not Found!','Meg Ryan made a rare public appearance in New York on Thursday where she was seen with Michael J.

Harry�s wife, Meghan Markle, will not be there, however. The Duchess of Sussex has decided to stay in Montecito, California, while the Duke travels to London. Harry�s visit across the Atlantic is expected to be brief and takes place amid increasing acrimony with his brother, Prince William, and his wife, the Princess of Wales. Reports in London suggest that many members of the royal family will be keeping their distance from the increasingly toxic Harry, following his salvo of attacks against the royals in his highly controversial memoir, \"Spare.\" Both Harry and Meghan have become increasingly unpopular in the United Kingdom since the release of \"Spare\" and their hugely hyped Netflix documentary, which debuted last November. They have, in fact, become two of the most disliked celebrity figures in the U.K. today. Their standing has also taken a major hit stateside, where the satirical show \"South Park\" delivered a devastating takedown of the royal couple in a recent episode.  Undoubtedly a key reason for Meghan�s decision not to attend the coronation was fear of being booed on the streets of London, a scene that would be immensely damaging to her carefully cultivated brand. If Harry and Meghan\'s goal was to undermine the royal family and the institution of the monarchy, which has stood for over a thousand years, they have failed spectacularly, and will continue to do so.  Another factor was the humiliation of being relegated to second-tier status as \"non-working royals,\" which denies them the right to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the coronation celebrations. KING CHARLES\' CORONATION INTIMATE GUEST LIST INCLUDES NOTABLE SNUBS The trajectory of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex over the past year has been a sharp downward spiral. Their attacks on the British monarchy have backfired spectacularly in both the U.S. and U.K., while their increasingly vocal political activism has alienated millions of Americans.  The decline and fall of Harry and Meghan have been swift and relentless, with growing calls in London, including from some members of Parliament, for the pair to be stripped of their royal titles. While the king has not publicly weighed in on this issue, reports in the British press suggest that the topic has been discussed at the highest levels of the palace. The Harry and Meghan saga is a modern-day tragedy, a tale of narcissism, hubris and outright greed.  Meghan and Harry have only themselves to blame for this rift. They have in effect declared war on the royals ever since their nasty, mean-spirited 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, which may have played well with the Hollywood elite but went over like a lead balloon in the U.K. Unproven allegations of racism within the royal household have been harmful to the monarchy and have resulted in significant tensions between Camp Harry and Meghan and other royals. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  The harsh reality is that the Sussexes are almost completely isolated from the larger royal family and are practically pariahs in the eyes of much of the British public. The king has extended an olive branch to his son by including him in the coronation, but there is absolutely no sign of any reconciliation between Harry and William. There is no realistic path for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in terms of any role in the future of the royal family. They may cling to their royal titles and the associated prestige the titles carry with them, but they are practically exiles in California, where they will no doubt continue to focus on building substantial personal wealth through their media deals and production ventures. They may ultimately become part of the Montecito elite, but their standing in the eyes of the British monarchy will be close to zero.    If their goal was to undermine the royal family and the institution of the monarchy, which has stood for over a thousand years, they have failed spectacularly, and will continue to do so. The Harry and Meghan saga is a modern-day tragedy, a tale of narcissism, hubris and outright greed.

At the Wall Street Journal\'s Future of Everything Festival on Wednesday, Obama announced the launch of PLEZi, a healthy food and beverage company she co-founded that is targeted at fighting childhood obesity. \"We\'re hoping not to just provide healthy and delicious drinks and snacks for kids, but to jumpstart a race to the top that will transform the entire food industry,\" Obama wrote in a PLEZi Nutrition press release announcing the launch. \"Because let\'s face it, even after everything we accomplished during the White House years, it is still simply too hard for kids to grow up healthy.\" PLEZi Nutrition is rolling out its first product, a fruit juice for kids, in four flavors that it says contains 75% less sugar than average leading 100% fruit juices.

Culpo � as UFO � took the stage in the first few weeks of the competition to sing \"Yellow\" by Coldplay, \"Stargazing\" by Kygo and \"Rocket Man\" by Elton John during a Battle Royale against Lamp, who was revealed to be Melissa Joan Hart.   DICK VAN DYKE AND SARA EVANS UNMASKED ON �THE MASKED SINGER� LEAVING ONE JUDGE IN TEARS  The public may not have been largely aware of Culpo\'s singing abilities, however, she says she \"loves singing.\" \"My whole family is very musical,\" Culpo explained, adding that her parents are both professional musicians. \"I\'ve played the cello since I was 6 years old. So when I wasn\'t traveling around for band camp, and orchestra and chamber music and lessons, I was in musical theater and I took singing lessons of course,\" she shared. \"It\'s a huge part of my DNA, and I do really enjoy it as a hobby.\"  In addition to competing on the \"Masked Singer,\" Culpo recently appeared on a reality show with her sisters Aurora and Sophia on TLC, called \"The Culpo Sisters.\" The show lasted one season consisting of six episodes. When discussing her time on reality TV, Culpo explained she felt filming a reality TV show \"is a little more jarring\" than performing on stage.  \"They\'re both so challenging, truly in very different ways. I think emotionally [leading] in public life is very, very hard sometimes and your job is to exploit that to a certain extent on a show,\" Culpo explained. \"It\'s very taxing personally, and it can get in the way of�the relationship you have with other people in your life who might not necessarily want to be portrayed in a certain way or even be on the show. \"With a performance. It\'s so nerve-wracking, but in a completely different way,\" Culpo, who also performed the cello during the talent portion of pageants, continued. \"Like you\'re responsible for creating the enjoyment of other people. That\'s a lot of pressure, but it\'s different. I think reality, I think, is harder in a way, because performing is cathartic. Music is cathartic. It\'s cathartic for the performer and for the people listening. And it\'s also a really cool way of communicating.\" Although Culpo comes from a family of performers and has spent so much of her life on a stage, she considered \"The Masked Singer\" to be \"unlike anything [she has] ever done before.\" \"I love the fact that on the Masked Singer, the most important thing is having fun,\" Culpo noted. One of the more fun parts of being on \"The Masked Singer\" for Culpo was that none of the judges, including Robin Thicke, Nicole Scherzinger, Jenny McCarthy and Ken Jeong, came even close to guessing it was her under the mask.  \"I personally love the fact that they had no idea that it was me. That was really fun,\" she explained. \"I don\'t think I would have had the same experience if they had guessed me right off the cuff, which they do sometimes with people on the show, so it was fun. I felt completely anonymous, and I know some people who go on the show can\'t say that. And I thought that was cool. I thought that made it more fun for me.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Something that was not so fun for Culpo was her costume, which she described as \"sparkly and heavy.\" \"I still have sparkles on like some of the sweat pant outfits that I wore going to set, even after multiple washes. So it was more sparkly than I had anticipated, and it was much heavier,\" Culpo said. \"The whole skirt had lighting and batteries and wires, and that weighs a lot. It really does. Like that was completely battery operated.\" Culpo said people keep asking her if she will continue to sing and perform, and while she does not think she will do it professionally, fans can catch her singing with her brother Gus on Tiktok.  \"He is a pianist. So every day, truly like every other day, he\'ll come over and beg me to sing with him while he plays the piano. Nine out of ten times I say no, but like every other week, he catches me on a good day, he\'ll make me a martini and we sing. I sing and he plays the piano.\"   \"The Masked Singer\" airs Wednesday nights on FOX.','Lori Bashian\r'),('Montana governor Greg Gianforte signs 5 pro-life bills: \'Every human life is precious and must be protected\'','2023-05-03T15:59:29-04:00','Media','Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signed a slate of pro-life bills Wednesday intended to protect the unborn as well as medical providers who have ethical objections to abortion. \"Today, we stand together � on the steps of the people�s house � to mark another historic day for Montana,\" Gov. Gianforte said. \"Today, we are protecting the lives of the most vulnerable amongst us: unborn children.\" The ceremony was broadcast live on the Republican\'s FaceBook page.  MONTANA JUDGE HALTS RULE THAT WOULD HAVE RESTRICTED MEDICAID COVERAGE TO SOME ABORTIONS \"Today, we�re giving a voice to the voiceless, help to the helpless,\" the governor said, addressing Montana voters at the bill signing ceremony outside the state capitol. Prior to signing the legislation, Gianforte touted his, and other conservative Montana lawmakers\' pro-life records. He claimed, \"You know me and you know how dedicated I am to the cause of life. Like you, I firmly believe that all life is precious and needs to be protected. I\'ve been proud to stand with you for life before I was in public service and now as your governor. And I\'m proud to stand with you today.\" One notable bill Gianforte signed protects infants born alive following a failed abortion. House bill 625, The Infant Safety and Care Act, requires medical providers to give life-saving care to these infants. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billing, recognizes these infants as legal persons deserving of medical care like any other newborn. A majority of Montana voters struck down a similar referendum on the 2022 midterm ballot. The bill addresses some concerns opponents to the referendum had last fall, such as lessening penalties for practitioners who violate the law from criminal to civil, the governor\'s office said.  MONTANA GOV. GREG GIANFORTE SIGNS BILL BANNING TRANSGENDER TREATMENTS FOR MINORS \"A civilized society should never deny lifesaving, medically necessary care to any child born alive, including one who survives an attempted abortion,\" GOP sponsor Rep. Seekins-Crowe said previously. Commenting on the bill at the ceremony, Gianforte declared, \"We must protect the lives of the innocent � little babies who are born alive following a botched abortion. Today we are giving a voiceless to the voiceless and help to the helpless. We\'re establishing in Montana law that a baby born alive following an attempted abortion is a patient, a human being who deserves life-saving care and the right to life.\" A second bill, HB 303, will protect healthcare workers from being discriminated against if they refuse to assist in an abortion due to ethical, moral, or religious objections. Another bill signed on Wednesday was Senate Bill 154. The GOP bill clarifies the right to privacy under state law, does not mean the right to an abortion or state funding of abortion. The governor signed two other pro-life bills on Wednesday � House Bill 786 and House Bill 575. The former requires there to be reporting on all women in the state harmed by abortion drugs, such mifepristone. The governor claimed this bill will \"hold those distributing these drugs accountable and shed light on the consequences of this practice.\" The latter bill prohibits abortions for unborn children past their point viability date of 24 weeks, unless the mother\'s life is endangered by the pregnancy. GOP state Rep. Lola Sheldon-Galloway, who sponsored the last two bills signed by the governor Wednesday, gave a few words at the signing, saying, \"I\'m a fighter for the unborn. I will always stand on that ground.\" Commenting on HB 575, she declared, \"Our Constitution protects us at viability. That needed to be defined.\" Two other bills awaiting the governor\'s signature prohibit taxpayer funds being used to pay for abortion, through a statewide adoption of the Hyde Amendment and a ban on elective abortions being covered through Medicaid.  MAINE POISED TO ALLOW ABORTIONS AFTER FETAL VIABILITY WITH MEDICAL REFERRAL While the Hyde Amendment restricts the use offederal dollars for abortion except to save the life of the mother or in casesof incest or rape, it does not prohibit states from using its own funds to cover abortions.  Other pro-life bills passed through the legislature include an adoption tax credit, a ban on dismemberment abortion, and increased oversight of abortion clinics. Under the proposed tax credit, Montana families would receive a $7,500 tax credit for each child adopted through the state\'s foster care system and $5,000. for a child adopted outside of it, on or after July 1, 2022. House bill 721 would ban dismemberment abortion, which is commonly called dilation and evacuation and used in second trimester abortions. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Matt Regier and has already received backlash from the abortion lobby.  MONTANA TRANSGENDER LAWMAKER ZOOEY ZEPHYR SUES AFTER BEING CENSURED BY REPUBLICANS Planned Parenthood of Montana filed a preemptive lawsuit in April seeking to stop the legislation before it hit the governor\'s desk. The lawsuit argues that H.B. 721 \"violates the Montana Constitution, which as the Montana Supreme Court held more than two decades ago in the Armstrong decision protects Montanans\' right to privacy and access to pre-viability abortions,\" Planned Parenthood argued. The governor\'s office blasted the lawsuit in a statement. \"The fact that the bill hasn�t even come to the governor�s desk for his review and Planned Parenthood is already running to court tells Montanans everything they need to know about the far left, pro-abortion group and its extreme tactics,\" press secretary Kaitlin Price wrote. Several Republican-led states have enacted bans on abortion following the Supreme Court\'s 2022 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. However, many of these state bans have been held up in the court system following lawsuits from abortion supporters.

That&apos;s down from the&#xA0;previous week&#xA0;when it averaged 6.43%. Mortgage rates, however, are still above last year when the average was 5.27%. The average rate for a 15-year mortgage was 5.76%, up from 5.71% the week before and up from 4.52% last year.&#xA0;&#xA0; On Wednesday, the Fed raised rates by another 25 basis points, indicating that it might be the last hike of the year. While a rate cut isn&apos;t yet in the cards, economists hope the central bank may begin&#xA0;reversing course in early 2024.&#xA0; The interest rate outlook should bode favorably for homebuyers, but they&apos;ll have other challenges to overcome, according to Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater.&#xA0; &quot;This week, mortgage rates inched down slightly amid recent volatility in the banking sector and commentary from the Federal Reserve on its policy outlook,&quot; Khater said. &quot;Spring is typically the busiest season for the residential housing market, and, despite rates hovering in the mid-six percent range, this year is no different.&#xA0; &quot;Interested homebuyers are acclimating to the current rate environment, but the lack of inventory remains a primary obstacle to affordability,&quot; Khater continued.&#xA0;&#xA0; If you are looking to take advantage of lower mortgage rates by refinancing your mortgage loan, or are ready to shop for the best rate on a loan,&#xA0;consider visiting an online marketplace like Credible to compare rates, choose your loan term, and get preapproved with multiple lenders at once.  HERE&#x2019;S WHY CONSUMERS&apos; CREDIT SCORES GOT A BOOST IN MARCH: REPORT  The lack of sellers is creating a housing inventory crunch. Homes for sale in April were 50.5% lower than they were in 2019, before the pandemic, according to Realtor.com&apos;s&#xA0;monthly housing trends report. Sellers cited concerns over buying a new home in a higher rate environment, the ability to get a good offer, and increased costs to get a house ready to sell as the top reasons they hesitated to put their homes up for sale, according to a recent Realtor.com&#xA0;site survey. &quot;A lack of new sellers and homes for sale continues to limit buyers&apos; choices and home sales,&quot; Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale said in a&#xA0;statement. &quot;Many sellers are likely future buyers too, which may be why a majority of would-be sellers report feeling &apos;locked in&apos; to their current home because of a low mortgage rate, especially younger homeowners. &quot;But older seller-buyers, who are likely to have a smaller mortgage balance and built up greater equity, are less likely to report feeling locked in by a low-interest rate and are more likely to report that they need to sell anyway, Hale continued. &quot;This likely means that older households will continue to play a prominent role on both sides of the home sale transaction this year.&quot; If you want to take advantage of interest rates before they potentially go up, you could consider shopping for the right mortgage or refinance your existing one.

MANY AMERICANS STILL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HOMEBUYING DESPITE TOUGH ECONOMIC BACKDROP: TD BANK  Homebuyers will also have to contend with rising home prices this spring. Home prices nationwide increased annually by 3.1% in March 2023, according to the latest CoreLogic home price index&#xA0;report.&#xA0; On a monthly basis, March home prices increased 1.6% from February. CoreLogic is forecasting that home values will rise another 0.8% in April. &quot;While housing markets across the country continue to send mixed signals, prices in many large metros appeared to have turned the corner, with the U.S. recording a second month of consecutive monthly gains,&quot; CoreLogic Chief Economist Selma Hepp said in a statement. &quot;At 1.6%, the month-over-month increase was twice the average seen between 2015 and 2020. &quot;The monthly rebound in home prices underscores the lack of inventory in this housing cycle,&quot; Hepp continued. &quot;In addition, while the lack of affordability generally weighs on home price growth, mobility resulting from remote working conditions appears to be a current driver of home prices in some areas of the country.&quot; Homebuyers may find a better mortgage rate by looking at several lenders.

Dance music duo Disclosure simply wrote, \"Thank you, Ed.\" Indian singer and songwriter Armaan Malik shared, \"No matter what, good people always win. Love and respect Ed.\" English chef and restaurateur Jamie Oliver commented, \"Well done mate.\" Miley Cyrus\' sister, Noah, also added a few hearts. ED SHEERAN MISSES GRANDMOTHER�S FUNERAL DUE TO COURT PROCEEDINGS The \"Castle on the Hill\" singer-songwriter gave a passionate speech after the ruling in which he expressed gratitude to the jury but also worried about what the lawsuit meant for future artists.

But, at the same time, I\'m unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all,\" he said. Sheeran was accused of using Gaye\'s \"Let\'s Get It On\" to create \"Thinking Out Loud.\" Gaye\'s song was co-written by late musician Ed Townsend, and Townsend\'s heirs sued in 2017. \"Thinking Out Loud\" was co-written by Amy Wadge, but she was not named in the suit. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER In closing arguments, Sheeran\'s lawyer focused on how the arrangement of common chords in the song were also used by many artists. Attorneys also argued there were no similarities in melodies or pitch and that the songs were very different. Townsend\'s counsel, Ben Crump, argued that Sheeran\'s celebrity status and connections could mislead people to ignore the truth. Crump also detailed how Townsend\'s legal team prepared seven years for the case.  When the father of two took the stand earlier this week, he said he found the lawsuit \"frustrating\" and \"insulting\" because he \"works hard\" to write his own music.  Sheeran also slammed the plaintiff\'s music expert, saying he gave a \"horrible depiction\" of \"Thinking Out Loud.\" \"I know he�s wrong because I wrote it myself,\" Sheeran said of the song. This isn\'t Sheeran\'s first time in the courtroom defending his music. He previously won a court fight in the U.K. in 2017 over his song \"Shape of You.\" The musician similarly criticized the lawsuit after that verdict.','Tracy Wright\r'),('National Day of Prayer: \'Our country needs prayer now as much as at any other time of national crisis\'','2023-05-04T07:42:28-04:00','Not Found!','Thursday, May 4, 2023, is the National Day of Prayer � a day observed typically on the first Thursday in May in the U.S. Two years ago, the National Day of Prayer went virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Pictures of the pasta � which has since been hauled away from the banks of the Iresick Brook, with the Department of Environmental Protection reporting no harm � went viral on social media this week.  There were likely about 200 pounds of alphabet noodles and spaghetti there, dumped across roughly 25 feet of woodland.

The malware, which is called Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), was specifically designed to only target Macs and steal sensitive information from Apple devices. Here\'s what we know so far and how you can protect your Mac computer. CLICK TO GET KURT�S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO�S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER What does AMOS do?  AMOS malware was found on a Telegram app channel being sold to hackers looking to wreak havoc. This malware\'s main purpose is to infiltrate your device and obtain confidential data such as keychain passwords, complete system information, files from your desktop and documents folder and macOS password.  This malware scarily has the ability to infiltrate popular browser apps such as Chrome and Firefox, quietly extracting sensitive information like autofill data, passwords, cookies and even credit card information.  And if that wasn\'t bad enough, it specifically targets popular crypto wallets like Electrum, Binance and Atomic. Who\'s spreading this malware?  A hacker can purchase AMOS through Telegram for a monthly fee of $1,000. It comes with a web interface (web panel) that simplifies the management of malware targets, as well as tools to guess private keys (brute-forcing). How does AMOS spread?  This malware is spread through a .dmg file, which macOS users may be familiar with as they are the files that install software onto their computers. Once the .dmg is opened, the software may display a fake prompt that looks like it\'s part of the computer\'s system. This prompt may ask for permission to access files stored on your desktop or in your documents folder. Once installed, it gets right to business quickly starting to gather private information and sending it to a faraway server.  Since it requires you to click on the .dmg file to install, you can avoid the malware completely by not installing any kind of untrusted software from an unverified source.

Hochul calls for \'justice\' in Jordan Neely subway chokehold death involving Marine veteran','2023-05-04T19:34:56-04:00','Not Found!','New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called for justice in the case of a Marine veteran accused of putting a homeless man in a chokehold on a New York City subway train just before he died. Hochul commented on the death of Jordan Neely, a Michael Jackson impersonator with a long criminal history, this week, saying his family deserved justice in the subway killing. \"I do want to acknowledge how horrific it was to view a video of Jordan Neely being killed for being a passenger on our subway trains,\" Hochul told reporters Thursday. \"I�m really pleased that the district attorney is looking into this matter. As I said, there had to be consequences, and so we�ll see how this unfolds.\" NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS \'MIGRANT CRISIS\' UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS \'DESTROYED\' CITY  \"But his family deserves justice,\" she added. The medical examiner has ruled Neely\'s death a homicide. The deadly incident unfolded around 2:30 p.m. Monday as Neely began acting erratic on a train. He allegedly threw garbage at a passenger. A 24-year-old Marine veteran, who has not been identified, put Neely in a chokehold for about 15 minutes. Two other passengers restrained Neely by holding his arms down and pinning his shoulders on the floor. During the chaos, Neely lost consciousness. EMTs arrived to revive him, but he was taken to a hospital and declared dead soon after. Neely reportedly complained about being thirsty and hungry and a passenger told the New York Post that while Neely was screaming aggressively, he did not physically attack anyone.  Fox News Digital has reached out to the Marine veteran\'s attorney. New York Mayor Eric Adams, a former New York transit police officer, was asked if passengers should take matters into their own hands. \"Each situation is different,\" he said during a Wednesday appearance on CNN. \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that.\" Hochul said the incident was a case of \"an individual who took the situation into his own hands.\" \"Just looking at that video, you know, it\'s wrong,\" she said of the incident, which was recorded. \"No one has the right to take the life of another person. And in this circumstance, I have said all along and have stood firm in our commitment to helping people with mental health challenges, giving them an alternative.\" U.S. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, in addition to other Democrats, criticized Adams\' remarks in a series of tweets.   \"This honestly feels like a new low: not being able to clearly condemn a public murder because the victim was of a social status some would deem �too low� to care about,\" she wrote. \"The last sentence is especially rich from an admin trying to cut the very services that could have helped him.\" New York City Comptroller Brad Lander also blasted the Marine veteran\'s actions in a tweet. \"NYC is not Gotham. We must not become a city where a mentally ill human being can be choked to death by a vigilante without consequence,\" he wrote. Adams has called it not \"very responsible\" for elected officials to denounce Neely\'s death as a murder as the investigation continues.

The state Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would ban most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, making exceptions for rape, incest, fetal abnormality, or danger to the life of the mother. North Carolina law currently allows abortion up to 20 weeks. The vote came about 24 hours after the state House passed the abortion bill along with dozens of others in a marathon voting session that stretched into late Wednesday night. Lawmakers took up 56 bills to meet a deadline after which legislation not involving appropriations or revenue or not part of a legislative study isn\'t eligible to be passed by the other chamber for the remainder of the 2023-24 legislative session. For its part, the Senate acted on another dozen bills. The abortion measure, which includes increased payments for foster care families and greater funding for childcare centers that aid low-income families, now goes to the desk of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who promised to veto it in a statement on Thursday.  NORTH CAROLINA GOP GOES ON OFFENSE, PUSHING AMBITIOUS AGENDA WITH NEW SUPERMAJORITY IN STATE HOUSE \"Don\'t let this so-called 12-week abortion ban fool you,\" said Cooper. \"It will effectively ban access to reproductive freedom earlier and sometimes altogether for many women because of new restrictions and requirements. This is why Republicans are ramming it through with no chance to amend. I will veto this extreme ban and need everyone\'s help to hold it.\" Cooper later tweeted out a video similarly slamming the bill and threatening to veto it.  However, Republicans now have a veto-proof supermajority in both chambers of the state legislature thanks to state Rep. Tricia Cotham, who announced last month that she was joining the Republican Party after serving her deep blue Charlotte-area district as a Democrat. While North Carolina Republicans already held strong majorities, Cotham\'s decision gave Republicans a supermajority in the House in what observers described as a \"political earthquake.\" The threat of a veto from Cooper, who has vetoed more than 75 measures since taking office in 2017, had prevented Republicans from implementing much of their agenda. But now the GOP has a clearer path to push a wide range of legislation � including on abortion. Cotham\'s vote may prove critical in potentially overriding Cooper\'s expected veto. While the newly minted Republican previously promised to codify Roe v. Wade in her state and has taken more liberal positions on other social issues, she voted in favor of the abortion ban this week. The state Senate also has a GOP supermajority. Beyond abortion, Cotham has taken the lead in pushing Republican-backed measures to expand school choice and implement other conservative reforms to education.  NORTH CAROLINA LAWMAKER OFFICIALLY LEAVES DEMS FOR GOP, SAYS TURNING POINT WAS AMERICAN FLAG CRITICISM One such bill that passed the House this week is designed to provide equal funding for charter school students as well as those attending traditional public schools. It would change the current factors which determine per-pupil funding that public school districts must share with local charter schools, with proponents arguing money should follow the student if their family chooses to attend a charter school. Another bill currently pending in both chambers that has full GOP support in the House would expand the state\'s school voucher program and existing Opportunity Scholarships � which are designed to allow low- and moderate-income families to attend the private school of their choice � to all students to attend private schools or cover educational expenses through a tiered system based on income. \"This is about putting kids first, about empowering families, and about changing education in North Carolina to benefit everyone across the state,\" Cotham said this week. \"At the end of the day, it\'s about putting kids first � not adults, not systems, not bureaucrats, but children.\" As chair of the Education K-12 House Standing Committee, Cotham is in a prime position to influence education reform bills that come out of the House.  NORTH CAROLINA GOP MOVE ON SCHOOL CHOICE WITH NEW SUPERMAJORITY AFTER DEM\'S STUNNING PARTY SWITCH The House this week also passed a measure to create a Charter School Review Board to take over approvals from the State Board of Education, while the Senate approved measures to restructure oversight of high school sports and transfer much of the power of oversight for the state\'s community college system from the governor\'s appointments to legislative appointments. Separately, both the House and Senate passed bills to ban environmental, social, and governance factors in state hiring, contracts, and pension decisions. So-called ESG factors are increasingly being used to measure an institution\'s advancement of policies designed to address climate change, increase demographic diversity, and support a progressive \"social justice\" agenda, among other initiatives. The House also advanced a bill to prohibit gender transition procedures for minors after recently passed legislation that would prohibit biological males who identify as female from playing on girls\' sports teams in middle school, high school and college.  NORTH CAROLINA BECOMES LATEST STATE TO PASS BILL BANNING TRANS ATHLETES FROM GIRLS\' SPORTS TEAMS This week\'s flurry of votes came after the newly GOP-controlled North Carolina Supreme Court on Friday upheld a photo voter identification law and overturned a previous ruling against gerrymandered voting maps � a measure that could have profound political implications for the Tar Heel state. \"I believe the legislature will revisit the congressional and legislative maps and redraw these maps as has been speculated,\" Chris Sinclair, a political strategist in North Carolina, recently told Fox News Digital. \"They don\'t need the governor for this, but believe they will draw a district for Cotham that is more competitive for an R than her current district, and she will support these new maps.\" However, he added, the GOP\'s newfound supermajority may prove problematic if they don\'t deliver for North Carolinians.  \"What [Republicans] do with their new member and how far they go on issues will be critical � and they must be mindful of how far they go and will want to talk to their colleagues in Wisconsin and Kansas on how right they shift on key issues � especially on abortion,\" said Sinclair. \"If they go too far, their newfound power could be short-lived after 2024, even with new maps.\"','Aaron Kliegman\r'),('On nightmare plane trip, man tries to help crying baby and mother as his own wife fumes','2023-05-04T23:04:28-04:00','Not Found!','It was hardly what you would call the ideal plane flight. \"So my wife and I recently went on a trip together,\" a man shared on Reddit recently.

He was always serious about his duty, and he always knew what his destiny was, but now it�s there� I think you can see the seriousness in the Wales� in a way that wasn�t there even a year ago.\"  \"We�ve recently been working with him in his role as president of the BAFTAs,\" Bullen continued. \"And it was very interesting � his whole demeanor was, in some ways, more serious than I�d seen it before. The things that he wanted to be involved in were very serious causes that had a real purpose. He doesn�t really want to talk about himself. The Princess of Wales doesn�t want to talk about herself. They want to really focus on the causes and the things that are important to them, as opposed to about them.\" Bullen pointed out that there�s a stark contrast between how the Prince and Princess of Wales operate versus Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they were stepping back as senior royals in 2020. They now reside in California.  Since their departure, the British prince and the former American actress have secured deals with Netflix and Spotify to produce original content. The couple has also repeatedly aired their unhappiness with the royals. In January, Harry, 38, wrote a memoir, \"Spare,\" which is dominated by his strained relationship with his elder brother. The Duke of Sussex recounted a long-standing sibling rivalry that worsened after he began a relationship with Markle, 41. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex married in 2018. Neither Buckingham Palace, which represents the king, nor William�s Kensington Palace office, has commented on any of the allegations. Most recently, Markle has signed for representation with powerhouse agency WME. While acting won�t be an area of focus, film and television production, as well as brand partnerships and overall business-building will be explored, Variety reported.

There�s no frivolity in them� They know they�ve got a job to do.\" Middleton, 41, is the first royal to hold the title of Princess of Wales since William�s late mother, Princess Diana. William, 40, and his wife have also inherited Charles and Camilla�s other honorary titles, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall. That means managing and taking income from the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate comprising land across the U.K. that is reportedly worth 1 billion pounds.  In addition to taking on royal duties in support of the king, both in the U.K. and overseas, Middleton devotes much of her time to several charitable causes, the royal family�s official website revealed. Many of those organizations are centered on early childhood development and support. In 2021, Middleton launched The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood. \"I�m told very clearly that the Princess of Wales is very much part of the decision-making process in Kensington Palace,\" said Bullen. \"She knows how best to work with William. And William, as we know from the stories of his explosions with Prince Harry, can have a temper. And I think the Princess of Wales is very good at managing the Prince of Wales. It�s a partnership, and he knows how good she is and what a useful tool she is for the royal family.\" PRINCE WILLIAM AND KATE MIDDLETON SMILE AND RIDE BICYCLES IN NEW PHOTO TO CELEBRATE 12TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY  \"And I think that�s the key to all of those successful royal marriages � it�s a real partnership,\" Bullen added. Now that he is king, Charles is expected to be more careful with his words and must stay out of politics and government policy, in accordance with the traditions of Britain�s constitutional monarchy. This presents an opportunity for William to step into that role as the royal family�s environmental advocate, and speak more forcefully about the issues once associated with his father. He already founded the Earthshot Prize, which is expected to hand out millions of pounds in grants for environmental initiatives over the next 10 years.  Royal expert Pauline Maclaran, author of \"Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture,\" previously told The Associated Press that William is keen to show \"how he will treat things differently\" as heir. That willingness to be approachable is critical for the House of Windsor as it seeks to remain relevant to younger people and cement its role in British society, she pointed out. \"It�s important that William shows there are going to be changes to the monarchy,\" said Maclaran. \"Otherwise, you know, I suspect it really can�t survive.\"','Stephanie Nolasco\r'),('Red Sox fans snub Bud Light at Fenway Park in viral video: Their concession stands are a \'ghost town\'','2023-05-04T17:30:39-04:00','Media','Boston Red Sox fans seemingly snubbed Bud Light vendors at Fenway Park on Wednesday, opting to purchase concessions at other stands as the beer brand remains embroiled in controversy over its partnership with transgender TikToker Dylan Mulvaney. A video posted on TikTok by a user named Luis Tejada shows a packed line of fans waiting to buy refreshments in what appears to be the bleacher concourse section of Fenway Park while a nearby stand selling Bud Light beer cans is empty. The video has garnered over 1.2 million views and generated 8,909 comments as of Thursday afternoon. \"Fenway Park Bud Light stand Ghost Town!\" Tejada wrote alongside the clip.  \"Guys, this is so funny and bizarre. Look at that,\" Tejadais heard saying, panning from a crowded line to an empty concession stand with workers awkwardly standing in front of a refrigerator stocked with blue Bud Light cans. \"Look at that,\" he says. \"That is every single Bud Light stand here at Fenway Park.\" The 38-second video was reportedly filmed Wednesday night during Boston\'s game against the Toronto Blue Jays, who lost to the Sox 8-3. FORMER BUD LIGHT DRINKERS SAY �TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE� AFTER BRAND TRIES TO MAKE AMENDS WITH PRO-AMERICA AD  The clip was the latest display of outrage among conservative Bud Light customers who\'ve boycotted the brand following Mulvaney\'s partnership that generated hefty backlash, prompting internal shakeups and boycotts across the country. After sending Mulvaney a personalized pack of beer with her likeness as part of an ad for the company\'s March Madness contest and to celebrate a year since Mulvaney began identifying as a woman, Anheuser-Busch lost some $5 billion in market value amid calls for a nationwide boycott. Bars and distributors across the country reported significant drops in Bud Light sales. Anheuser-Busch CEO Michel Doukeris addressed the Bud Light controversy on an earnings call with investors Thursday, downplaying the brand\'s partnership with the transgender influencer. BUD LIGHT IS �BETTING� ITS CUSTOMERS WILL �FORGET� DYLAN MULVANEY CONTROVERSY: ANSON FRERICKS Doukeristold investors there is \"misinformation\" spreading on social media about the company\'s team-up with Mulvaney. \"We need to clarify the facts that this was one can, one influencer, one post and not a campaign,\" Doukeris said in an effort to distance from the Mulvaney controversy.  The campaign included a beer can with Mulvaney\'s face printed on it as part of Bud Light\'s March Madness contest and as a way to celebrate a full year of \"girlhood.\"  A second video featured a bikini-clad Mulvaney frolicking in a bathtub while drinking a Bud Light beer as part of the partnership. Backlash has been significant, starting with many wondering if the pact was some sort of April Fool�s gag. In the days since, country music singer John Rich said he pulled cases of Bud Light from his Nashville bar, conservative rocker Kid Rock used severalBud Lightcases for target practice in a viral video, Anheuser-Busch distributors in rural areas have expressed concern and the beer juggernaut�s value took a hit.  To combat those losses and its tarnished reputation with customers, the beer brewer is reportedly scrambling to \"make amends\" with wholesale distributors who�ve suffered from the controversial partnershipby sending each wholesale distributor employee a free case of Bud Light, The Wall Street Journalreported.','Yael Halon\r'),('Rep. Gaetz, Sen. Mullin introduce national �Stand Your Ground� bills: �Legal duty to retreat� helps attacker','2023-05-04T11:38:51-04:00','Not Found!','FIRST ON FOX: Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, both Republicans, are proposing a national \"Stand Your Ground\" law against attackers. Gaetz caught up over the phone with Fox News Digital on Thursday about his and Mullin�s companion bills dropping the same day, with the Florida Republican saying the proposed law came out of his efforts in the Sunshine State legislature \"after the Trayvon Martin death.\" While chairman of the Florida House�s Criminal Justice Subcommittee, Gaetz said he held hearings on the state�s Stand Your Ground law amid \"national calls to repeal\" the statute. ATF DIRECTOR REFUSES TO DEFINE �ASSAULT WEAPON,� SAYS IT�S UP TO CONGRESS  \"I became even more convinced that the legal duty to retreat from common law puts the law on the side of the attacker, not the victim,\" Gaetz said. \"And as I�ve gotten to Congress, I don�t believe that the legal duty to retreat as an American ought to be different in Florida and Connecticut and Massachusetts and California,\" he continued. \"I think we ought to have a national reckoning on the duty to retreat, and we ought to extinguish it,\" Gaetz added. Gaetz said America has \"too many states that continue to maintain the duty to retreat if one is attacked outside their home\" and that Congress \"should supersede that state law because it leaves Americans vulnerable.\" The Florida Republican noted that in \"our nation�s capital today,\" a person being attacked on the street has to make a \"split-second\" decision on whether they can \"turn their back and run,\" with a \"miscalculation\" potentially proving \"fatal.\"  \"And if you miscalculate toward the side of self-defense, you could be under arrest,\" Gaetz said. \"If someone is intending to commit a forcible felony on an American, an American right should be meeting that force with comparable force.\" Gaetz said he is seeing increasing support for the measure among his GOP colleagues and said Mullin�s companion bill in the Senate \"is a big boost.\" \"Since I serve on the Judiciary Committee, I�m going to be using that perch to inject my views on self-defense and extinguishing the duty to retreat in the various legislative proposals that the committee may consider,\" Gaetz said. Gaetz also blasted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying he �hasn�t been the greatest when it comes to putting the law on the sides of the victim.\" \"He seems to hold a different view, so we may have to use leverage on a must-pass bill to get Stand Your Ground considered,\" Gaetz said. The Florida congressman said \"in practice,\" Stand Your Ground laws have \"stopped arrests on sight when someone has engaged in legitimate self-defense.\" \"That defanged arrest has a chilling effect when someone justly defends themselves,\" Gaetz added. Mullin told Fox News Digital that states \"like Oklahoma and Florida recognize that in some cases, the use of lethal force is justified to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm.\" \"Every American should have the right to defend himself or herself against imminent threats to personal safety without the duty to retreat,\" Mullin said. \"I�m proud to introduce the Stand Your Ground Act in the Senate to codify these commonsense self-defense protections for all law-abiding Americans,\" he added.  Stand Your Ground laws, such as the one in Florida, allow law-abiding persons in a lawful place who are attacked to forcefully defend themselves from death or great injury, including with deadly force, without having to retreat first if the person believes it�s reasonably necessary to do so. The Republicans� bill comes as Democrats in Congress and the White House aim to expand gun control amid rising crime in America. Last month, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Director Steve Dettelbach refused to define the term \"assault weapon,\" saying it was a decision for Congress. Dettlebach testified before the House Judiciary Committee to speak about the pistol brace rule that would outlaw common stabilizing mechanisms. Dettlebach was questioned by Democratic Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who asked the ATF director whether he knew what an \"assault weapon\" was after acknowledging the recent mass shooting in Buffalo, New York. \"Let me just hold up just to pay tribute and acknowledge that these are the deceased � their families are still mourning � of the incident in Buffalo at the grocery store. It was an assault weapon that killed them,\" said Lee. She continued: \"My question to you is just simply a �yes� or �no.\' You know what an assault weapon is? You\'ve seen one?\"  Dettlebach deflected the question, saying the term is not something he\'s qualified to rule on. \"Again, that would be a decision for Congress to make, respectfully, as to make that definition. It is� There are numerous different legislative bodies that have taken up that question,\" Dettlebach said before being cut off.  \"If we laid a weapon on the table, you could pretty much say, �That falls in the category of assault weapon?\'\" Lee interjected during Dettlebach\'s testimony. The ATF director did not budge, responding: \"Respectfully, that is a decision that different legislative bodies have come up with different definitions for. It would be for the legislators to make that determined action as to how they would define it unless they were to delegate that authority to ATF.\" Fox News Digital\'s Timothy H.J.

The partisan bill, which seeks to amend Title IX to prohibit schools that receive federal funding from allowing biological men from participating in women\'s sports, passed the House late in April with a 219-203 vote. All the \"yes\" votes came from Republicans, and all the \"no\" votes came from Democrats, several of whom accused Republicans of \"bullying\" transgender student-athletes with their support of the legislaton.  In an interview on \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" Thursday, Gaines said she finds it baffling that the \"spineless\" male lawmakers who have daughters were willing to succumb to political pressure while foregoing their obligations as fathers to protect their children.

The student said the school was putting the safety of women in \"jeopardy\" by allowing transgender students to use the same bathroom and locker rooms as female students, alluding to a physical altercation captured in a viral video showing a transgender student assaulting a female student on campus. Parents reportedly told Fox 11 in Los Angeles the transgender student has a history of \"erratic and uncomfortable behavior\" and had access to the girls� bathrooms and locker rooms. Students told the outlet that the student \"shows his genitals\" in the girl\'s locker room. The student was later expelled from the school.

When the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates, it creates higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending. For most borrowers, the higher interbank lending rate &#x2013; which affects borrowing costs, including everything like home equity lines of credit, auto loans and credit cards &#x2013; is bad news. Even a slightly higher rate for both can mean thousands of dollars for consumers to pay. But there is also a silver lining in higher rates for many consumers. FED RAISES INTEREST RATES A QUARTER POINT, HINTS AT POSSIBLE PAUSE  While the federal funds rate is not what consumers pay directly, most banks and credit unions will raise their savings rate during periods of higher interest rates, making it a good chance for some Americans, particularly retirees living off of their savings, to earn more. The national average banking savings rate was 0.24% as of May 4, according to Bankrate, with rates as measly as 0.1% at some of the biggest banks in the U.S. Thanks to the Fed&apos;s aggressive rate-hike campaign that began more than a year ago, however, there are now far more lucrative options for savers: high-yield savings accounts. Many high-yield savings accounts are now paying between 4.2% and 4.8%, providing a low-risk option for consumers who are seeking a lower-risk return. Savers can open an online high-yield savings account, but they should make sure the bank is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ARE TECH LAYOFFS THE CANARY IN THE US JOBS MARKET?  There are now more than two dozen nationally available savings and money market deposit accounts from FDIC-insured banks paying a rate of 3.75% or higher, according to Bankrate.&#xA0; Some of the best rates are being offered by Vio Bank (4.77%, with a minimum balance of $100), BankPurely (4.75%, with a minimum balance of $25,000), CIBC Bank USA (4.37%, with a minimum balance of $1) and Emigrant Bank (4.35%, with a minimum balance of $0). None of the banks charge a minimum fee. MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FUNDS REPORTEDLY POURED INTO APPLE HIGH-YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS UPON ROLLOUT Apple also recently debuted a new savings account in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The savings account is available to Apple Card customers and offers a yield of 4.15% with no minium deposits and no fees.

Henry McMaster signing a Republican-backed school choice bill into law Thursday. \"This is a great step forward for our state and I think we will find enormous success and happiness because of it,\" McMaster, also a Republican, said at the bill\'s signing. The law gives the Palmetto State�s low- and middle-income families the opportunity to apply for a $6,000 voucher for each child for education-related expenses through the Education Scholarship Trust Fund program.  WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE \"Among the benefits are not just preparing our people to live happy, strong, healthy, meaningful lives � the impact on our economic growth will be enormous,\" McMaster said. He noted that the specific ideas in the legislation came from other states. \"Everything in this new law works and will work well � work extremely well � for the people of South Carolina,\" he added. \"This goes right to the heart of that educational strength.\" Other speakers at the press conference noted that the push for vouchers in South Carolina has been ongoing since 2004. The vouchers can be spent on private school tuition, tutoring, online schooling costs, standardized tests, textbooks and more. The law will gradually roll out, starting by allowing households that do not exceed twice the federal poverty level to apply for the 2024-2025 school year, then expanding in the 2026-2027 school year to families making four times the poverty level. Additionally, the participant amount is capped with 5,000 for the 2024-2025 school year and gradually increasing to 15,000 for the 2026-2027 school year. KANSAS SCHOOL CHOICE BILL CLEARS MAJOR HURDLE Students are only eligible if they are entering kindergarten or went to public school the year prior, according to the law. Unused funds will roll over to the following school year if the student remains eligible, according to the legislation.  Two-thirds of South Carolina families will be eligible to apply for the vouchers by 2026, according to News 19.

In addition to serving as a chat companion, the bot can also have some practical purposes, such as offering gift-buying advice, planning trips, suggesting recipes and answering trivia questions, according to Snap. However, while it�s not billed as a source of medical advice, some teens have turned to My AI for mental health support � something many medical experts caution against. One My AI user wrote on Reddit, \"The responses I received were validating, comforting and offered real advice that changed my perspective in a moment where I was feeling overwhelmed and stressed � It�s no human, but it sure comes pretty close (and in some ways better!)\" CHATGPT FOUND TO GIVE BETTER MEDICAL ADVICE THAN REAL DOCTORS IN BLIND STUDY: �THIS WILL BE A GAME CHANGER� Others are more skeptical. \"The replies from the AI are super nice and friendly, but then you realize it�s not a real person,\" one user wrote. \"It�s just a program, just lines and lines of code. That makes me feel a little bit sad and kind of invalidates all the nice things it says.\" AI could bridge mental health care gap, but there are risks Some doctors see a great potential for AI to help support overall mental wellness, particularly amid the current nationwide shortage of providers. \"Technology-based solutions may be an opportunity to meet individuals where they are, improve access and provide �nudges� related to usage and identifying patterns of language or online behavior that may indicate a mental health concern,\" Dr. Zachary Ginder, a psychological consultant in Riverside, California, told Fox News Digital.  \"Having direct access to accurate mental health information and appropriate prompts can help normalize feelings and potentially help get people connected to services,\" he added. Caveats remain, however. Dr. Ryan Sultan, a board certified psychiatrist, research professor at Columbia University in New York and medical director of Integrative Psych NYC, treats many young patients � and has mixed feelings about AI�s place in mental health. CHATGPT FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: CAN THE AI CHATBOT MAKE THE PROFESSIONALS\' JOBS EASIER? \"As this tech gets better � as it simulates an interpersonal relationship more and more � some people may start to have an AI as a predominant interpersonal relationship in their lives,\" he said. \"I think the biggest question is, as a society: How do we feel about that?\" \"Using My AI because I�m lonely and don�t want to bother real people,\" said one person on Reddit. Some users have expressed that the more they use AI chatbots, the more they begin to replace human connections and take on more importance in their lives. \"Using My AI because I�m lonely and don�t want to bother real people,\" one person wrote on Reddit. \"I think I�m just at my limits of stuff I can handle, and I�m trying to �patch� my mental health with quick-fix stuff,\" the user continued. \"Because the thought of actually dealing with the fact I have to find a way to find living enjoyable is too much.\" CHATGPT AND HEALTH CARE: COULD THE AI CHATBOT CHANGE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE? Dr. Sultan said there are a mix of opinions about Snapchat�s My AI among the youth he treats. \"Some have said it�s fairly limited and just gives general information you might find if you Googled a question,\" he explained. \"Others have said they find it creepy. It�s odd to have a non-person responding to personal questions in a personal manner.\" He added, \"Further, they don�t like the idea of a large private, for-profit cooperation having data on their personal mental health.\" Providers raise red flags  Dr. Ginder of California pointed out some significant red flags that should give all parents and mental health providers pause.  \"The tech motto, as modeled by the reported rushed release of My AI � of �moving fast and breaking things� � should not be used when dealing with children�s mental health,\" he told Fox News Digital. With My AI�s human-like responses to prompts, it may also be difficult for younger users to distinguish whether they�re talking to an actual human or a chatbot, Ginder said. \"AI also �speaks� with clinical authority that sounds accurate at face value, despite it occasionally fabricating the answer,\" he explained. SOUTH CAROLINA PRIEST SAYS \'THERE\'S NO PLACE\' FOR AI AFTER ASIA CATHOLIC CHURCH USES IT FOR SYNODAL DOCUMENT The potential for misinformation appears to be a chief concern among mental health providers. In testing out ChatGPT, the large language model that powers My AI, Dr. Ginder found that it sometimes provided responses that were inaccurate � or completely fabricated. \"This has the potential to send caregivers and their children down assessment and treatment pathways that are inappropriate for their needs,\" he warned. \"It�s odd to have a non-person responding to personal questions in a personal manner.\" In discussing the topic of AI with other clinical providers in Southern California, Ginder said he\'s heard similar concerns echoed. \"They have seen a significant increase in inaccurate self-diagnosis as a result of AI or social media,\" he said. \"Anecdotally, teens seem to be especially susceptible to this self-diagnosis trend. Unfortunately, it has real-world consequences.\" A large share of Snapchat�s users are under 18 years of age or are young adults, Ginder pointed out. \"We also know that children are turning to social media and AI for mental health answers and self-diagnosis,\" he said. \"With these two factors at play, it is essential that safeguards be put into place.\" How is Snapchat�s My AI different from ChatGPT? ChatGPT, the AI chatbot that OpenAI released in December 2022, has gained worldwide popularity (and a bit of notoriety) for writing everything from term papers to programming scripts in seconds. Snap�s My AI is powered by ChatGPT � but it�s considered a \"light\" version of sorts.  \"Snap�s AI feature uses ChatGPT as the back-end large language model, but tries to limit how the AI engages with Snapchat users and what things the AI model will respond to,\" explained Vince Lynch, AI expert and CEO of IV.AI in Los Angeles, California. \"The goal here is to request that the AI would chime in with relevant things for a Snapchat user � more like an AI companion versus a tool for generating new content.\" Snap cites disclaimers, safety features Snap has been clear about the fact that My AI isn�t perfect and will occasionally provide erroneous information. \"While My AI was designed to avoid misleading content, My AI certainly makes plenty of mistakes, so you can�t rely on it for advice � something we�ve been clear about since the start,\" Maggie Cherneff, communications manager at Snap in Santa Monica, California, said in an email to Fox News Digital. \"My AI certainly makes plenty of mistakes, so you can�t rely on it for advice.\" \"As with all AI-powered chatbots, My AI is always learning and can occasionally produce incorrect responses,\" she continued. \"Before anyone can first chat with My AI, we show an in-app message to make clear it�s an experimental chatbot and advise on its limitations.\" The company has also trained the chatbot to detect particular safety issues and terms, Cherneff said. \"This means it should detect conversations about sensitive subjects and be able to surface our tools, including our �Safety Page,� �Here for You� and �Heads Up,� in regions where these resources are available,\" she said.  Here for You is an app-wide tool that provides \"resources from expert organizations\" whenever users search for mental health issues, per the company�s website. The feature is also available within AI chats. AI�s role in mental health is �in its infancy� \"Snap has received a lot of negative feedback from users in the App Store and people are expressing concern online\" in response to My AI, Lynch told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"This is to be expected when you take a very new approach to technology and drop it into a live environment of people who require time to adjust to a new tool.\" There is still a long road ahead in terms of AI serving as a safe, reliable tool for mental health, in Dr. Sultan�s opinion.  \"Mental health is a tremendously delicate and nuanced field,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The current tech for AI and mental health is in its infancy. As such, it needs to both be studied further to see how effective it is � and how negative it could be � and further developed and refined as a technology.\"','Melissa Rudy\r'),('Texas AG launches investigation into Austin hospital over gender transition procedures on young children','2023-05-05T10:03:52-04:00','Not Found!','FIRST ON FOX: Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is launching an investigation into the Dell Children�s Medical Center over \"gender transitioning\" procedures on children. \"It is deeply disturbing, and there is no place for it in Texas. Along these lines, there have been a number of recent reports about potentially illegal activity at Dell Children�s Medical Center, and this investigation aims to uncover the truth,\" Attorney General Ken Paxton said. The lawsuit is the latest push by Republicans to investigative hospitals providing sex change treatments, sometimes called \"gender affirming\" care, to minors. Roughly 100 bills have been introduced, and 16 states have passed laws restricting transition-related medical procedures for minors. \"There are countless heartbreaking stories of young children who have been convinced to undergo experimental, life-altering procedures and are now filled with regret and health challenges,\" Paxton told Fox News Digital. \"That is an absolute tragedy, and it cannot continue.\"  OKLAHOMA GOVERNOR MAKES PERFORMING \'IRREVERSIBLE GENDER TRANSITION SURGERIES\' ON CHILDREN A FELONY Paxton\'s legal action follows a report from Project Veritas, which appeared to show the Dell Children�s Medical Center admitted to having patients \"starting as young as eight, nine\" who receive gender-transitioning care. \"In regards to prescribing [puberty blockers], that�s up to the prescriber�s discretion. And they might just require a couple of appointments just to see,\" the Dell Children�s Center social worker told an undercover Project Veritas reporter. \"It might be appropriate after one. It�s not something that we want to gate-keep.\"  Following the report, Texas Republicans Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Chip Roy wrote a letter to the Dell Children�s Center requesting answers about the hospital�s funding and \"gender dysphoria\" treatments. LAWS PROTECTING GENDER SURGERIES FOR CHILDREN ADVANCE IN WASHINGTON, OREGON OVER REPUBLICAN OBJECTIONS \"We, along with millions of Texans, find it deeply concerning that DCMC is providing experimental, unproven, and dangerous medical procedures to young children,\" the letter read. \"Rather than attempting the impossible and permanently marring children�either through chemical experimentation or the amputation of perfectly healthy organs�DCMC should seek to help young Texans by assisting them in accepting the truth about their bodies.\"  Other states have moved in the opposite direction, advancing gender transition procedures. In Washington state, Senate Bill 5599 was passed to \"remove barriers to accessing temporary, licensed shelter accommodations for youth\" and provide \"protected health services.\" In Oregon, House Bill 2002 proposes insurance coverage for \"any combination of gender-affirming treatment procedures.\"  The American Civil Liberties Union has also called moves by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to advance restrictions on gender-transitioning procedures a part of an \"ongoing fight to erase transgender people from public life.\" \"We cannot allow kids to be indoctrinated by �transgender� activists who care more about left-wing ideology than the long-term health of children,\" Paxton said.','Lacey Christ\r'),('The new Toyota Tacoma will have this old-school feature','2023-05-05T09:38:41-04:00','Not Found!','The 2024 Toyota Tacoma is expected to be a clutch model for the brand.

In celebration of the food holiday, take a look at some of the most popular breakfast cereals and when they were released throughout the years. Which cereal debuted the decade you were born? THE ICONIC CHILDHOOD TOYS THAT DEBUTED THE DECADE YOU WERE BORN  1940s Cheerios were first released in 1941 under the name \"Cheerioats,\" according to the General Mills website.

Rates last updated on May 5, 2023. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here. Actual rates may vary. Credible, a personal finance marketplace, has 5,000 Trustpilot reviews with an average star rating of 4.7 (out of a possible 5.0). What this means: Mortgage rates have begun to dip back down. Rates for 30-year terms have edged down to 6.25%. Rates for 10-year terms also fell slightly, to 5.5%. Meanwhile, rates for 20-year terms have fallen below 6% by dropping a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75%. Rates for 15-year terms are today&#x2019;s lowest, at 5.125%, after dropping by a quarter of a percentage point. Homebuyers looking to save the most on interest should consider 15-year terms. Borrowers who would rather have a smaller monthly payment should instead consider 20-year terms, as their rates are a half of a percentage point lower than those of 30-year terms. To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible&#x2019;s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible&#x2019;s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.  Based on data compiled by Credible, mortgage refinance rates have held steady across all key terms since yesterday.  Rates last updated on May 5, 2023. These rates are based on the assumptions shown here. Actual rates may vary. With 5,000 reviews, Credible maintains an &quot;excellent&quot; Trustpilot score. What this means: Mortgage refinance rates have held steady across all key terms, giving borrowers the opportunity to lock in a term of their choice with a rate below 6%. Rates for 30-year terms are today&#x2019;s highest, at 5.99%, followed by 20-year terms at 5.625%. Both 10- and 15-year terms have today&#x2019;s lowest rates at 5.25%. Borrowers looking to refinance into a smaller monthly payment should consider 20-year terms, as their rates are over a quarter of a percentage point lower than those of 30-year terms. Homeowners who would rather maximize their interest savings should instead consider 10- or 15-year terms.   Today&#x2019;s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac &#x2014; 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years. The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today&#x2019;s lower interest rates. When considering a mortgage or refinance, it&#x2019;s important to take into account closing costs such as appraisal, application, origination and attorney&#x2019;s fees. These factors, in addition to the interest rate and loan amount, all contribute to the cost of a mortgage.&#xA0;   Changing economic conditions, central bank policy decisions, investor sentiment and other factors influence the movement of mortgage rates. Credible average mortgage rates and mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible. The rates assume a borrower has a 700 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%. Credible mortgage rates reported here will only give you an idea of current average rates. The rate you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors.  Credit scores are a snapshot of your credit history, and they usually range from 300 to 850. FICO, a widely used credit-scoring model, breaks down credit scores this way:  To qualify for a conventional loan &#x2014; one that&#x2019;s not backed by any government agency &#x2014; you&#x2019;ll usually need a fair credit score of at least 620. But it&#x2019;s possible to qualify for FHA loans, which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration, with a poor credit score as low as 500.&#xA0; And Veterans Administration loans, which are for veterans, active-duty service members, and their spouses, have no minimum credit score requirements. USDA loans, which help very low-income Americans buy in certain rural areas, also have no minimum credit score requirements. If you&#x2019;re trying to find the right mortgage rate, consider using Credible.

On Monday, UC Berkeley professor Elizabeth Hoover apologized for being a \"white person who has incorrectly identified as Native my whole life.\" Hoover, an Ivy League-educated expert on environmental health and food justice in Native American communities, further apologized for causing harm by \"uncritically living an identity based on family stories without seeking out a documented connection to these communities.\" \"Having my family claim Native identity does not mean Native nations claimed us. By claiming an identity as a woman of Mohawk and Mi�kmaq descent without confirming it with communities of origin, and by not confirming kinship ties back to politically and culturally affiliated Indigenous peoples, I betrayed and hurt my students, collaborators, and friends,\" she wrote. \"I have negatively impacted people emotionally and culturally. For this hurt I have caused, I am deeply sorry.\"  WHITE PEOPLE BANNED FROM OFF-CAMPUS UC BERKELEY STUDENT HOUSING COMMON AREAS In an attempt to \"work to meaningfully make amends,\" Hoover shared a long list of commitments, such as declaring she will \"put away my dance regalia, ribbons skirts, moccasins, and Native jewelry. I�ve begun to give away some of these things to people who will wear them better.\" She reportedly does not plan on giving up the power and prestige she won over the years, however. \"Hoover said she doesn�t plan to resign, despite a call for her to do so from more than 360 people, including other Native American scholars and activists, as well as current and former students from UC Berkeley and Brown,\" Mercury News reported. \"UC Berkeley said in December that it didn�t plan to remove her from her position.

Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report&#xA0;released Friday, easily beating the 180,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 3.4%, a historically low level, as more workers left the labor force.&#xA0; Wages also accelerated last month, with average hourly earnings &#x2013; a key measure of inflation &#x2013; rising 0.5%, more than the 0.3% estimate. On an annual basis, wages rose 4.4% in April.&#xA0; Although the report pointed to solid hiring in April, it also showed much weaker job growth over the previous two months. Gains for February and March were revised down by a total of 149,000 jobs to a respective 248,000 and 165,000, the government said.&#xA0; FED RAISES INTEREST RATES A QUARTER POINT, HINTS AT POSSIBLE PAUSE  The Federal Reserve is closely watching the report for evidence that the labor market is finally softening after months of strong job gains as policymakers try to wrestle inflation under control. Although the consumer price index has cooled from a peak of 9.1% in June, it remains about three times higher than the pre-pandemic average. The stronger-than-expected jobs figure, coupled with a burst in wage growth, could be a worrisome sign for the Fed, which approved a 10th straight interest rate hike on Wednesday afternoon before opening the door to a pause in the tightening cycle. ARE TECH LAYOFFS THE CANARY IN THE US JOBS MARKET? &quot;Robust jobs numbers in the face of ongoing regional bank stress and debt ceiling uncertainty speaks to the strength of our economy, but it complicates the fight against inflation,&quot; said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. &quot;Today&#x2019;s strong jobs report may be good news for job seekers, but it may make it more difficult for the Fed.&quot;&#xA0;  Job gains were broad-based last month, with the biggest gains in professional and business services (43,000), health care (40,000) and leisure and hospitality (31,000). Even industries that are more sensitive to higher interest rates, like construction and manufacturing, added workers last month. &#xA0; Still, the outlook for the labor market remains hazy.&#xA0; A spate of bank collapses this spring is threatening to further restrict economic growth and hiring by tightening lending standards and making it more difficult to acquire a loan. Borrowers may have to agree to more stringent terms like high interest rates as banks try to reduce the financial risk on their end. Fewer loans, in turn, would lead to less big-ticket spending by consumers and businesses. SILVER LINING OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES: SAVINGS ACCOUNT RATES Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, including hiring and inflation.&#xA0;  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE There has also been a wave of notable layoffs over the past few months, and the list continues to grow. Amazon, Apple, Meta, Lyft, Facebook, Google, IBM, Morgan Stanley and Twitter are among the companies letting workers go. For many economists, the possibility of unemployment rising has become a question of when, not if. The central bank previously projected in March that the jobless rate will climb substantially higher to 4.6% and remain elevated in 2024 and 2025 as steeper rates continue to take their toll by pushing up borrowing costs. That could amount to more than 1 million job losses. Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slow the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.','Megan Henney\r'),('Video shows Ukrainian delegate punching Russian official who grabbed flag','2023-05-05T11:05:00-04:00','Not Found!','A Ukrainian delegate was captured on video punching a Russian official in the face after his country�s flag was taken from him while trying to photobomb a video interview with the lead delegate from Moscow.

NEWSPAPER USES VIDEO GAME TO SMUGGLE UKRAINE WAR TRUTHS TO RUSSIAN CITIZENS  The incidents come as Russian leaders are speculating that the U.S. is behind analleged attack on President Vladimir Putin\'s life.  Unconfirmed videos have been circulating online appearing to show a drone being shot down over the Kremlin and smoke rising in Moscow. No injuries or damage to Putin\'s residence were reported. The Russian leader was seen in video and photos released Wednesday meeting with a regional governor outside Moscow. The Kremlin claims a drone attempted to assassinate Putin on Thursday, originally speculating it was an attack by Ukraine forces.  \"We know that often it isn�t even Kyiv that determines the targets, but Washington,\" Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, said at a briefing, according to the Moscow Times. He continued, \"It�s very important that Washington understands that we know this and understands how dangerous such direct involvement in the conflict is.\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told CNN Thursday that Peskov is \"lying.\"   \"There\'s a word that comes to mind that I\'m obviously, not appropriate to use on national TV,\" Kirby said when asked for his reaction. \"Obviously it\'s a ludicrous claim,\" Kirby continued. \"The United States had nothing to do with this. We don\'t even know exactly what happened here� but I can assure you the United States had had no role in it whatsoever.� We neither encourage nor do we enable Ukraine to strike outside Ukraine\'s borders.\" Fox News� Timothy H.J.

The report claimed Friday that \"tensions\" between Hunter Biden and President Biden\'s aides over his legal defense have led Hunter Biden to hire a new lawyer for a more \"combative approach\" without consulting with his father�s legal advisors. A former top DOJ spokesman noted that the younger Biden going rogue with his legal decisions and perhaps pushing past the \"guardrails\" that the president�s advisers would have him follow, could be \"a legitimate headache the White House.\" STATE DEPARTMENT DUCKS QUESTIONS ON CHARGE THAT BLINKEN ORCHESTRATED HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP COVER STORY  The tensions between Hunter Biden and the White House over his legal defense have risen as the president�s son is facing investigations on several fronts. There�s the DOJ investigation into his potential charges of tax fraud and illegally purchasing a firearm, investigations into his alleged business corruption by Republicans in Congress, and also a child support court case in Arkansas. The piece began with the statement, \"Top aides to President Biden have clashed with Hunter Biden\'s team over strategies for dealing with the legal battles and Republican attacks that surround the president\'s son.\" As Axios noted, much of the heartburn over legal strategies has prompted Biden�s decision to hire new lawyer Abbe Lowell � who recently represented former President Donald Trump�s son-in-law, Jared Kushner � without input from his father�s people. The outlet stated, \"The tensions led Hunter � without involving the president\'s top aides � to hire prominent lawyer Abbe Lowell in December, as part of a plan to take a more combative approach than the White House and Hunter\'s previous lawyer had taken.\" Additionally, the White House is wincing as Biden�s team is \"moving toward creating a legal defense fund, and hiring ethics advisers for it.\" The report added, \"High-level Democrats and others are worried about the idea of the president\'s son soliciting money to pay for his legal troubles.\" WHITE HOUSE DODGES QUESTION ON BIDEN REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS �SEVENTH GRANDCHILD�  Former Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley told the outlet, \"For this fund to work, it must be extraordinarily transparent and even restrictive by prohibiting foreign citizens and registered lobbyists from contributing.\" However, the White House is reportedly worried Biden�s team will not be careful enough. Coley, who was senior adviser to Attorney General Merrick Garland, added, \"Without these type of guardrails, the fund will be a legitimate headache for the White House.\" The piece detailed just how thorny Lowell�s hiring was to people who were previously advising the president�s son. Axios wrote, \"Lowell\'s hiring was abrupt and unwelcome among some involved in Hunter Biden\'s legal matters.\" It mentioned how longtime Biden lawyer, Bob Bauer, who had recommended Hunter Biden�s previous lawyer, \"had no role in hiring Lowell\" and \"was simply informed that Lowell was being hired.\" More drama ensued from the decision, with the previous lawyer, Josh Levy, resigning shortly after. Due to the erratic relationship between Hunter Biden�s legal team and White House legal advisors, Bauer and White House officials met with Lowell and asked him \"to improve the communication from Hunter\'s team.\"  The new hire also reflects how \"Hunter\'s team has shifted from largely not commenting on GOP attacks or stories in conservative tabloids to publicly fighting back,\" Axios wrote, noting that, as such, \"Lowell has become an increasingly powerful force in Hunter\'s orbit.\"  The report noted that no final decision has been made as to the creation of a legal defense fund, though it informed readers that Biden is \"reportedly millions of dollars in legal debt.\"','Gabriel Hays\r'),('Why Thomas Edison should be considered the patron saint of homeschooling','2023-03-21T07:00:40-04:00','Not Found!','PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Fox News contributor and author Raymond Arroyo discuss this topic and more on \"Fox &amp; Friends\" on Tuesday, March 21 at 7:30 a.m. ET. Though Thomas Alva Edison�s creations and ingenuity are legendary, most don�t realize that Edison almost wasn�t the world�s greatest inventor. A curious and reckless child, young Edison wanted to know the inner workings of the world around him and was not afraid to dive into the canal behind his house or into a grain elevator to find answers. At five, his zeal to understand fire ended with the family barn in ashes and a whipping from his dad. His at times dangerous curiosity and endless questions drove his father to distraction, who wrote the boy off as \"a dunce.\" But his mother saw something else in her Al.    GREATEST INVENTOR OF ALL TIME WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT A KEY PERSON IN HIS LIFE While creating my new \"Turnabout Tales\" picture book series for ZonderKidz/HarperCollins, I spied a common thread that ran through Edison�s life and those of other historic figures. Each found themselves in a moment of crisis where a decision made not only changed the course of their lives but the course of history itself. I believe each of us has a \"Turnabout Tale,\" whether in our past or in the future.  Edison�s \"Turnabout\" really began at age eight. Little Al was registered at the Reverend GB Engle�s schoolhouse in 1855. The rote lessons and memorization were likely boring to Al. He daydreamed through classes and his biographers think he may have had ADHD. Edison said of this period: \"The teachers did not sympathize with me and�my father thought I was stupid.\" His teacher did as well. One day, in front of Al, the Reverend Engle complained that the boy was \"addled\" and \"unable to be taught.\" Al ran home in tears. The next day, Mrs. Edison appeared at the school, upbraided the teacher, insisted that her son had more smarts than even the Reverend and that she would educate Al herself. Astoundingly, this marked the end of Edison�s formal education and the beginning of the great inventor.  Nancy Edison was a teacher by trade and equipped her son with a combination of literary classics and science manuals that fed his passion. She encouraged Al�s daring, hands on experimentation. Young Edison absorbed the theory of the books he read while practically applying them; constructing his own telegraph to a neighbor�s house and dabbling with chemicals in his home lab. Despite a few explosions in the basement and acid burns on her furniture, Ms. Edison indulged Tom�s pursuits. I don�t know why Thomas Edison isn�t the patron saint of home-schooling. He said late in life:\"My mother was the making of me�she let me follow my bent. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should very likely have never become an inventor.\"  It was this line, that I discovered accidentally, that led me to write \"The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison\" and to try to capture this neglected bit of history for our own time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Like a lot of children, Edison was underestimated and disparaged at a young age. Being deaf from the age of 12, he was likely withdrawn. But where others would regard the loss of hearing a liability, Edison saw it as a blessing. \"Deafness probably drove me to reading.\" Edison said once. It also gave him time to think and ponder. How incredible it is that a man who had to bite down on a piece of wood to hear sounds in his laboratory, created the phonograph, the telephone receiver, and the microphone. But it was the model of discovery and innovation that he learned from his mother that would mark the rest of his creative life.Edison confronted challenges with his head and his hands. Surrounded by books, at his \"Invention Factory\" in Menlo Park, New Jersey and later at the Edison Labs in West Orange, New Jersey he would hurl himself across worktables to tinker and feel his way through the process of creation. Edison would fill thousands of notebooks with ideas for new inventions. By the end of his life, he would file more than 1,000 patents and transform the lives of millions around the globe. The alkaline battery, the lightbulb, the motion picture camera, the tattoo pen, and the first electric car�all sprang from the mind of a boy who was tossed out of school and told he was too dumb to be taught. At a moment when we are in danger of losing a sense of who we are, stories like Edison�s must be preserved and spread. History reminds us of our past but more importantly lends us needed guidance as we move into the future. Before we give up on the next average student or evict a child from the classroom, remember Thomas Edison and his mother. If it hadn�t been for Nancy Edison, we might all still be in the dark.  The incredible ingenuity and light of Edison, which has spanned more than a century, might never have reached us were it not for a devoted parent who saw promise in her son where others only saw problems. I hope this first \"Turnabout Tale: helps us all to see the possibility in every young life and to recognize the responsibility we as adults have to nurture the light within them.

The Fulton County Medical Examiners\' Office confirmed her death to Fox News Digital hours after suspect Deion Patterson was captured in Cobb County following the Wednesday afternoon attack. He has since been charged with one count of murder and four counts of aggravated assault. \"CDC is deeply saddened by the unexpected loss of a colleague killed today in the Midtown Atlanta shooting,\" the health agency said in a statement. \"Our hearts are with her family, friends, and colleagues as they remember her and grieve this tragic loss.\"  A LinkedIn profile purportedly belonging to St. Pierre listed her as being a CDC Public Health Advisor. St. Pierre\'s family released a statement on her death. \"Our beloved Amy was brilliant, kind, big-hearted and simply the \'best of the best\'. An Emory honors graduate and Georgia State MBA, Amy traveled the world with curiosity and courage. She was driven by compassion, both in her work in the field of maternal mortality, and in her everyday life,\" the statement said. \"Amy was selfless always, she wanted more for others but never for herself. Generous supporter of worthy causes, she was the social conscience of our family.\" The family confirmed St. Pierre was married with two children. ATLANTA SHOOTING SUSPECT CAPTURED IN COBB COUNTY Patterson, the suspected shooter, had an appointment at a Northside Medical building and opened fire shortly after arriving in an attack that lasted about two minutes, law enforcement officials said at a news conference Wednesday night. Patterson then went to a Shell gas station and took a pickup truck that had been left running and unattended, authorities said. Atlanta Police Deputy Chief Charles Hampton Jr. declined to discuss any details of the investigation or a possible motive, saying, \"Why he did what he did, all of that is still under investigation.\"  The other victims were identified by police as being a 39-year-old female, a 71-year-old female, a 56-year-old female and a 25-year-old female, according to Fox5 Atlanta. The station reports that three of the patients sent to alocal hospital are in serious condition and are recovering inan intensive care unit. Two of those people had to undergo surgery. The fourth victim is reported to be doing well. WHO IS DEION PATTERSON, THE ATLANTA SHOOTING SUSPECT?  In 911 dispatch audio, first responders could be heard discussing an \"active shooter\" while sirens blared in the background. \"They are advising a female is shot, she is seriously bleeding, shot in the side and the back,\" one dispatcher said. The shooting occurred around noon inside a building on West Peachtree Street between 12th and 13th Streets, the Atlanta Police Department said. Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum told reporters that all five victims were shot in a waiting area on the 11th floor of the building. Patterson is a former member of the U.S. Coast Guard, according to the office of public affairs for the military branch.   He first entered the service in July 2018 and worked his way up to an Electrician�s Mate Second Class before being discharged from active duty in January 2023. The Coast Guard did not provide additional details about the condition of Patterson�s discharge from service. \"The Coast Guard is aware of the tragic incident in Atlanta allegedly involving Mr. Deion Patterson,\" the public affairs office said. \"Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families. The Coast Guard Investigative Service is working closely with the Atlanta Police Department and local authorities in the investigation.\" Fox News� Stephen Sorace, Greg Wehner, and the Associated Press contributed to this report.','Greg Norman\r'),('WWE star Zelina Vega has eyes on women\'s title at Backlash in Puerto Rico: \'It�s a dream come true\'','2023-05-05T05:00:18-04:00','Not Found!','Backlash will be the first WWE premium live event held in the aftermath of WrestleMania 39 where Rhea Ripley defeated Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women�s Championship. The event will take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico � the first time a WWE premium live event will take place in the territory since New Year�s Revolution in 2005. While the event � hosted by Bad Bunny � is sure to attract thousands of wrestling fans, it means more for Zelina Vega. Vega, whose real name is Thea B�dgen, will be battling Ripley for the SmackDown Women�s Championship. It will be Ripley�s first title defense since she beat Flair in an epic battle during the first night of the star-studded spectacle in Inglewood, California. Vega is of Puerto Rican decent and will be wrestling in the territory for the first time in her career. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  \"It�s exciting. It�s surreal. It�s nerve-racking. It�s a dream come true,\" Vega told Fox News Digital in a recent interview days before Backlash kicks off. \"And not just the match, really, but the location. Like, getting to do it in Puerto Rico is something I never thought was going to be the case. And to have this kind of a match there is crazy. The family that lives there will finally see me wrestle in person. It�s really cool.\" WWE announced it would be going back to Puerto Rico in March. Vega said that when she heard the news she immediately tried to decide how she was going to get herself on the card. Two days after the announcement, Vega turned face and joined Legado Del Fantasma in helping Rey Mysterio against Judgment Day. The group would re-form the Latino World Order (LWO), and on April 21, Vega would request and be granted a match against Ripley for the championship at Backlash. \'STONE COLD\' STEVE AUSTIN TALKS STATE OF PRO WRESTLING, \'HONORED\' TO HAVE LASTING IMPACT ON WWE  Vega is the only female Puerto Rican superstar on the main WWE roster. She said she felt a \"responsibility\" to be the representation for the locker room. \"It�s a huge responsibility, but it�s one that I take very seriously, and I�m happy I get to do it,\" she told Fox News Digital, \"because, my God, it�s something that even when I was younger, to be able to say, to look at [former WWE superstar] Melina and [think], �Wow, she�s in WWE, and that�s where I want to be.� And Rey, he�s smaller in stature like me, I love that. I feel like I can do this, too.\" \"So, I had that representation when I as younger, and I just want to be able to be that in a bunch of different ways but for other people as well. I just [want] to be what Rey Mysterio was growing up,\" Vega continued. WWE has been all over the globe over the last year, hosting premium live events like Clash at the Castle in Scotland and Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia. WWE also launched a talent search across Africa to find the next great superstar.  \'STONE COLD\' STEVE AUSTIN REVEALS HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO WWE RETURN AT WRESTLEMANIA 39 Saturday�s Puerto Rico event appears to be just another example of the company�s global reach. \"WWE is like a beast in the best of ways,\" Vega told Fox News Digital. \"I think they�re very big on just having a melting pot of beautiful cultures altogether. They�re very big on inclusivity and everybody and find something in common with someone here.\" \"We talk about Rhea, and I�ve seen people say, �Oh, wow, she dresses like me. She likes the same bands that I do. I have something in common with her, so I can relate with her,�\" she continued. \"With me, it�s like, �Oh my God, she loves anime like I do, and she likes gaming and stuff just like I do.� We have different things people can find in common with us, and I feel like WWE is really good at making sure that everybody feels included.\"  Vega is just one of 39 women superstars who wrestle full time on the main roster. While there is a women�s championship and a women�s tag-team championship, there isn�t a mid-card title belt akin to that of an Intercontinental Championship of United States Championship on the men�s side. Vega told Fox News Digital it could be time for that to change. BOOKER T PREVIEWS WWE DRAFT, FLOATS IDEA FOR MID-CARD BELT FOR WOMEN\'S DIVISION \"I hope so,\" she said when asked whether WWE should introduce a mid-card women�s title. \"And to be fair, I thought that�s kind of what Queen of the Ring could have been. When I won that crown, I was like, �Yeah, I�m down to put it on the line.� Like, we�ll have matches for the crown. There were so many ideas that I had for Queen of the Ring.  \"But I think because it was just so new, and it was the first ever, you know, they put me in with Carmella, and it got kind of complicated to try and do all of that at once. I do think it would be beneficial definitely to have another title, another opportunity for other girls to win some gold.\" Backlash is set for Saturday at 8 p.m. ET in the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos� Miguel Agrelot. Bad Bunny will the host of the show. Backlash will stream live on Peacock.  Here�s the card:','Ryan Gaydos\r');
